Here is the full description of the method: 


getRequestHeader
public abstract String getRequestHeader(String name)
Returns the value of the specified request header. If the request
 did not include a header of the specified name, this method returns
 null. If there are multiple headers with the same name, this method
 returns the first header in the request. The header name is
 case-insensitive. This is a convienence method to get a header
 (instead of using the getRequestHeaders()).

Parameters:
name - the name of the request header
Returns:
returns the value of the requested header,
         or null if the request does not have a header of that name

I want to learn how to use String getRequestHeader(String name) from javax.xml.ws.spi.http.HttpExchange
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }

Here is a simple example of how to use the `getRequestHeader` method from the `javax.xml.ws.spi.http.HttpExchange` class:

```java
import javax.xml.ws.spi.http.HttpExchange;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Assume we have an HttpExchange object named exchange
        HttpExchange exchange =...;

        // Get the value of a specific request header
        String headerValue = exchange.getRequestHeader("Content-Type");
        System.out.println("Content-Type: " + headerValue);

        // Get all request headers
        List<String> headerNames = exchange.getRequestHeaderNames();
        for (String headerName : headerNames) {
            System.out.println(headerName + ": " + exchange.getRequestHeader(headerName));
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we first assume that we have an `HttpExchange` object named `exchange`. We then use the `getRequestHeader` method to get the value of a specific request header (in this case, "Content-Type"). We also use the `getRequestHeaderNames` method to get all the names of the request headers, and then use the `getRequestHeader` method again to get the value of each header.

Please replace `...` with the actual `HttpExchange` object you have.

getResponseBody
public abstract OutputStream getResponseBody()
                                      throws IOException
Returns a stream to which the response body must be
 written. setStatus(int)) must be called prior to calling
 this method. Multiple calls to this method (for the same exchange)
 will return the same stream.

Returns:
the stream to which the response body is written
Throws:
IOException - if any i/o error during response processing

Here is a simple example of how you can use `getResponseBody()` method from `javax.xml.ws.spi.http.HttpExchange`.

```java
import javax.xml.ws.spi.http.HttpExchange;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.OutputStream;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HttpExchange httpExchange = new HttpExchange() {
            @Override
            public void close() throws IOException {

            }

            @Override
            public OutputStream getResponseBody() throws IOException {
                return null;
            }

            @Override
            public void setStatus(int i) {

            }
        };

        try {
            OutputStream outputStream = httpExchange.getResponseBody();
            outputStream.write("Hello, World!".getBytes());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we are creating an anonymous class that implements `HttpExchange` interface. We are overriding `getResponseBody()`, `setStatus()` and `close()` methods. In `getResponseBody()`, we are returning `null` because we are not actually writing anything to the response body.

In the `main` method, we are creating an instance of `HttpExchange` and calling `getResponseBody()` method. We are writing "Hello, World!" to the output stream returned by `getResponseBody()`.

Please note that this is a very basic example and does not cover all the possible scenarios. In a real-world application, you would need to handle more complex scenarios such as setting HTTP headers, handling exceptions, etc.
