@@ Context
Here is the description of the package Classes for matching character sequences against patterns specified by regularexpressions.
Here is the description of the class An engine that performs match operations on a character sequence by interpreting a Pattern.

@@ Instruction
I want to use java.util.regex.Matcher package from Java
Given the context, recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, 
Do not recommend methods inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
1. `Pattern compile(String regex)`: This method compiles the given regular expression into a pattern.
2. `Matcher matcher(CharSequence input)`: This method creates a matcher that will match the given input against this pattern.
3. `boolean find()`: This method attempts to find the next subsequence of the input sequence that matches the pattern.
4. `boolean matches()`: This method attempts to match the entire region against the pattern.
5. `boolean lookingAt()`: This method attempts to match the input sequence, starting at the beginning, against the pattern.

3. `String pattern()`: This method returns the pattern string of this matcher's pattern.

4. `String[] split(CharSequence input)`: This method splits the given input sequence around matches of this pattern.

5. `String[] split(CharSequence input, int limit)`: This method splits the given input sequence around matches of this pattern. The limit parameter controls the number of times the pattern can match.
