Here is a complete code snippet of the method `HijrahDate date(int prolepticYear, int month, int dayOfMonth)` from the `java.time.chrono.HijrahChronology` class:

```java
import java.time.chrono.HijrahChronology;
import java.time.chrono.HijrahDate;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HijrahChronology chrono = HijrahChronology.INSTANCE;
        HijrahDate date = chrono.date(2022, 1, 1);
        System.out.println(date);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first import the necessary classes. Then, we create an instance of `HijrahChronology` and use the `date` method to create a `HijrahDate`. The `date` method takes three parameters: the proleptic year, the month, and the day of the month. The `date` method returns a `HijrahDate` object, which we then print to the console.

Please note that the `date` method throws a `DateTimeException` if the provided parameters do not form a valid date in the Hijrah calendar.

Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.
 
 This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.
 For example, on a LocalDate, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.
 The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.
 
 In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined. For example, if the target object is
 a date representing the 31st January, then changing the month to February would be unclear.

Here is the description of the class: A date in the Hijrah calendar system.
Here is the full description of the method: 


with
public HijrahDate with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)
Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.
 
 This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 TemporalAdjusters.
 These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 
 Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:
 
  date = date.with(Month.JULY);        // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
  date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth());  // static import from Adjusters
  date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY));   // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
 

Specified by:

Parameters:
adjuster - the adjuster to use, not null
Returns:
an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
Throws:
DateTimeException - if unable to make the adjustment.
     For example, if the adjuster requires an ISO chronology

 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 TemporalAdjusters.
 These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 
 Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:
 
  date = date.with(Month.JULY);        // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
  date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth());  // static import from Adjusters

Parameters:
adjuster - the adjuster to use, not null
Returns:
an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
Throws:
DateTimeException - if unable to make the adjustment.
     For example, if the adjuster requires an ISO chronology
ArithmeticException - if numeric overflow occurs

import java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println("Original date: " + date);
        System.out.println("Adjusted date: " + adjustedDate);
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create a `HijrahDate` object for the current date. Then we use the `with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)` method to adjust the date to the next Wednesday. The `TemporalAdjusters.next(TemporalAdjusters.WEDNESDAY)` adjuster ensures that the date is adjusted to the next Wednesday.

Finally, we print out the original and adjusted dates.

Please note that the `HijrahDate` class is part of the Java 8 date and time API and it's not available in Java 7 or earlier versions.

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

Here is a complete code snippet of the `with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)` method from `java.time.chrono.HijrahDate`:

```java
import java.time.chrono.HijrahDate;
import java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjuster;
import java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HijrahDate date = HijrahDate.now();
        HijrahDate adjustedDate = date.with(TemporalAdjusters.next(TemporalAdjusters.WEDNESDAY));
        System.out.println("Original date: " + date);
        System.out.println("Adjusted date: " + adjustedDate);
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create a `HijrahDate` object for the current date. Then we use the `with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)` method to adjust the date to the next Wednesday. The `TemporalAdjusters.next(TemporalAdjusters.WEDNESDAY)` adjuster ensures that the date is adjusted to the next Wednesday.

Finally, we print out the original and adjusted dates.

Please note that the `HijrahDate` class is part of the Java 8 date and time API and it's not available in Java 7 or earlier versions.

Here is the description of the class: A date in the Hijrah calendar system.
Here is the full description of the method: 


with
public HijrahDate with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)
Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.
 
 This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 TemporalAdjusters.
 These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 
 Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:
 
  date = date.with(Month.JULY);        // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
  date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth());  // static import from Adjusters
  date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY));   // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek

Parameters:
adjuster - the adjuster to use, not null
Returns:
an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
Throws:
DateTimeException - if unable to make the adjustment.
     For example, if the adjuster requires an ISO chronology

        System.out.println("Original date: " + date);
        System.out.println("Adjusted date: " + adjustedDate);
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create a `HijrahDate` object for the current date. Then we use the `with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)` method to adjust the date to the next Wednesday. The `TemporalAdjusters.next(TemporalAdjusters.WEDNESDAY)` adjuster ensures that the date is adjusted to the next Wednesday.

Finally, we print out the original and adjusted dates.

Please note that the `HijrahDate` class is part of the Java 8 date and time API and it's not available in Java 7 or earlier versions.

@@ Context
Here is the description of the package: Generic API for calendar systems other than the default ISO.
Here is the description of the class: A date in the Hijrah calendar system.
Here is the full description of the method: 


with
public HijrahDate with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)
Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.
 
 This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.
 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 TemporalAdjusters.
 These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 
 Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:
 
  date = date.with(Month.JULY);        // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster
  date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth());  // static import from Adjusters
  date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY));   // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek
 

Specified by:
with in interface ChronoLocalDate
Specified by:
with in interface Temporal
Parameters:
adjuster - the adjuster to use, not null
Returns:
an object of the same type with the specified adjustment made, not null
Throws:
DateTimeException - if unable to make the adjustment.
     For example, if the adjuster requires an ISO chronology
ArithmeticException - if numeric overflow occurs

In this code snippet, we are importing the `ThaiBuddhistDate` class from `java.time.chrono` package. Then, we are calling the `of` method of `ThaiBuddhistDate` class to create a new `ThaiBuddhistDate` object. The `of` method takes three parameters: `prolepticYear`, `month`, and `dayOfMonth`. We are passing these parameters as `2563`, `1`, and `1` respectively. Finally, we are printing the date object to the console.

Please note that the `of` method throws `DateTimeException` if the value of any field is out of range, or if the day-of-month is invalid for the month-year. So, you should handle this exception if you want to make your code robust.
