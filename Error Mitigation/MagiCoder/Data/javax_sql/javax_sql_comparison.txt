@@ Context
Here is the description of the package Provides the API for server side data source access and processing fromthe JavaTM programming language.
Here is the description of the class An Event object that provides information about the source of a connection-related event.

@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.sql.ConnectionEvent package from Java
Given the context, recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, 
Do not recommend methods inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
1. `public void setSource(Object source)`: This method sets the source of the connection event.
2. `public Object getSource()`: This method returns the source of the connection event.
3. `public void setSQL(String sql)`: This method sets the SQL string of the connection event.
4. `public String getSQL()`: This method returns the SQL string of the connection event.
5. `public void setConnection(Connection conn)`: This method sets the connection of the connection event.
6. `public Connection getConnection()`: This method returns the connection of the connection event.
