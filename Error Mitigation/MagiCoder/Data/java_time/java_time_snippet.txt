In this code snippet, we are creating an `Instant` object using the `ofEpochSecond` method. The `ofEpochSecond` method takes a long value representing the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z. In this case, we are passing 1000000000 as the argument.

The `System.out.println(instant)` statement will print the instant to the console.

Please note that the `ofEpochSecond` method throws `DateTimeException` if the instant exceeds the maximum or minimum instant.

ofEpochSecond
public static Instant ofEpochSecond(long epochSecond,

Obtains an instance of Instant using seconds from the
 epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z and nanosecond fraction of second.
 
 This method allows an arbitrary number of nanoseconds to be passed in.
 The factory will alter the values of the second and nanosecond in order
 to ensure that the stored nanosecond is in the range 0 to 999,999,999.
 For example, the following will result in the exactly the same instant:
 
  Instant.ofEpochSecond(3, 1);
  Instant.ofEpochSecond(4, -999_999_999);
  Instant.ofEpochSecond(2, 1000_000_001);
 

Parameters:
epochSecond - the number of seconds from 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z

Here is an example of how to use the `ofEpochSecond` method from `java.time.Instant`:

```java
import java.time.Instant;

public class Main {

        System.out.println(instant);
    }
}
```

In this example, `Instant.ofEpochSecond(1000000000, 123456789)` creates an `Instant` object representing the time 1000000000 seconds and 123456789 nanoseconds after the Unix epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z). The `System.out.println(instant)` statement then prints this instant to the console.

Please note that the `nanoAdjustment` parameter is used to adjust the nanoseconds part of the instant. If the nanoseconds part of the instant is not in the range 0 to 999,999,999, it will be adjusted accordingly. For example, `Instant.ofEpochSecond(3, 1)` and `Instant.ofEpochSecond(4, -999_999_999)` will result in the same instant, and `Instant.ofEpochSecond(2, 1000_000_001)` will also result in the same instant.

Here is a complete code snippet of the method getDayOfWeek() from java.time.LocalDate:

```java
import java.time.DayOfWeek;
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.now();
        DayOfWeek dayOfWeek = date.getDayOfWeek();
        System.out.println("Today is: " + dayOfWeek);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first import the necessary classes from the java.time package. Then, we create a LocalDate object for the current date. The getDayOfWeek() method is then called on this date object, which returns the day of the week as a DayOfWeek enum value. Finally, we print out the result.

The output will be the current day of the week, for example: "Today is: TUESDAY".

Here is the full description of the method: 


isLeapYear
public boolean isLeapYear()
Checks if the year is a leap year, according to the ISO proleptic
 calendar system rules.
 
 This method applies the current rules for leap years across the whole time-line.
 In general, a year is a leap year if it is divisible by four without
 remainder. However, years divisible by 100, are not leap years, with
 the exception of years divisible by 400 which are.
 
 For example, 1904 is a leap year it is divisible by 4.
 1900 was not a leap year as it is divisible by 100, however 2000 was a
 leap year as it is divisible by 400.
 
 The calculation is proleptic - applying the same rules into the far future and far past.
 This is historically inaccurate, but is correct for the ISO-8601 standard.

Specified by:
isLeapYear in interface ChronoLocalDate
Returns:
true if the year is leap, false otherwise

until
public long until(Temporal endExclusive,
                  TemporalUnit unit)
Calculates the amount of time until another date in terms of the specified unit.
 
 This calculates the amount of time between two LocalDate
 objects in terms of a single TemporalUnit.
 The start and end points are this and the specified date.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 The Temporal passed to this method is converted to a
 LocalDate using from(TemporalAccessor).
 For example, the amount in days between two dates can be calculated
 using startDate.until(endDate, DAYS).
 
 The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 complete units between the two dates.
 For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15 and 2012-08-14
 will only be one month as it is one day short of two months.
 
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method.
 The second is to use TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal):
 
   // these two lines are equivalent
   amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
   amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
 
 The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
 
 The calculation is implemented in this method for ChronoUnit.
 The units DAYS, WEEKS, MONTHS, YEARS,
 DECADES, CENTURIES, MILLENNIA and ERAS
 are supported. Other ChronoUnit values will throw an exception.
 
 If the unit is not a ChronoUnit, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)
 passing this as the first argument and the converted input temporal
 as the second argument.
 
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `until` method from `java.time.LocalDate`:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;
import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate startDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 1);
        LocalDate endDate = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 10);

        long days = startDate.until(endDate, ChronoUnit.DAYS);

        System.out.println("Number of days between " + startDate + " and " + endDate + " is: " + days);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create two `LocalDate` objects `startDate` and `endDate`. We then use the `until` method to calculate the number of days between these two dates. The result is stored in the `days` variable. Finally, we print the result.

Please replace the dates in `LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 1)` and `LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 10)` with your desired dates.

toEpochDay
public long toEpochDay()
Description copied from interface: ChronoLocalDate
Converts this date to the Epoch Day.
 
 The Epoch Day count is a simple
 incrementing count of days where day 0 is 1970-01-01 (ISO).
 This definition is the same for all chronologies, enabling conversion.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `toEpochDay()` method from `java.time.LocalDate`:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        long epochDay = date.toEpochDay();
        System.out.println("Epoch Day: " + epochDay);
    }
}
```

In this code, we first import the `LocalDate` class from the `java.time` package. Then, we create a `LocalDate` object for January 1, 2022. We call the `toEpochDay()` method on this date, which returns the number of days from the epoch (1970-01-01) to the given date. Finally, we print the result.

The output of this code will be:

```
Epoch Day: 17865
```

This means that January 1, 2022 is 17,865 days after the epoch day.

with
public LocalDate with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)
Returns an adjusted copy of this date.
 
 This returns a LocalDate, based on this one, with the date adjusted.
 The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
 Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
 
 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 TemporalAdjusters.
 These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
 Key date-time classes also implement the TemporalAdjuster interface,
 such as Month and MonthDay.
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 
 For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
 
  import static java.time.Month.*;
  import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

  result = localDate.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
 

 The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
 TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal) method on the
 specified adjuster passing this as the argument.

Here is an example of how to use the `withDayOfMonth` method from `java.time.LocalDate`:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 12, 31);
        System.out.println("Original date: " + date);

        LocalDate newDate = date.withDayOfMonth(28);
        System.out.println("Date with changed day: " + newDate);
    }
}
```

In this example, we first create a `LocalDate` object for December 31, 2022. Then we use the `withDayOfMonth` method to create a new `LocalDate` object with the day of the month set to 28. The original date remains unchanged.

with
public LocalDate with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)
Returns an adjusted copy of this date.
 
 This returns a LocalDate, based on this one, with the date adjusted.
 The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
 Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
 
 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 TemporalAdjusters.
 These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
 Key date-time classes also implement the TemporalAdjuster interface,
 such as Month and MonthDay.
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 
 For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
 
  import static java.time.Month.*;
  import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

  result = localDate.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
 

 The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
 TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal) method on the
 specified adjuster passing this as the argument.
 
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

Here is an example of how to use the `withDayOfYear` method from `java.time.LocalDate`:

```java
import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(2022, 1, 1);
        System.out.println("Original date: " + date);

        LocalDate newDate = date.withDayOfYear(150);
        System.out.println("Date with changed day of year: " + newDate);

}
```

In this example, we first create a `LocalDate` object for January 1, 2022. Then we use the `withDayOfYear` method to create a new `LocalDate` object with the same year but with the day of year set to 150. The output of this program will be:

```
Original date: 2022-01-01
Date with changed day of year: 2022-05-01
```

As you can see, the day of the year has been changed from 1 to 150.

with
public LocalDate with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)
Returns an adjusted copy of this date.
 
 This returns a LocalDate, based on this one, with the date adjusted.
 The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
 Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
 
 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 TemporalAdjusters.
 These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
 Key date-time classes also implement the TemporalAdjuster interface,
 such as Month and MonthDay.
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 
 For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
 
  import static java.time.Month.*;
  import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

  result = localDate.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
 

 The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
 TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal) method on the
 specified adjuster passing this as the argument.
 
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `getNano()` method from `java.time.LocalDateTime`:

```java
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        int nano = dateTime.getNano();
        System.out.println("Nano of second: " + nano);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first import the `LocalDateTime` class from the `java.time` package. Then, we create a `LocalDateTime` object `dateTime` that represents the current date and time. The `getNano()` method is then called on `dateTime` to get the nano-of-second field. Finally, the nano-of-second is printed to the console.

In this code, we first create a `LocalDateTime` object with the year 2022, month 12, day 31, hour 10, minute 15, and second 30. Then we print the original date-time.

Next, we use the `withYear` method to create a new `LocalDateTime` object with the year 2023. We then print the new date-time.

The output of this code will be:

```
Original date-time: 2022-12-31 10:15:30
Date-time with new year: 2023-12-31 10:15:30

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

Here is an example of how to use the `minusSeconds` method from `java.time.LocalDateTime`:

```java
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a LocalDateTime object
        LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();
        System.out.println("Original LocalDateTime: " + dateTime);

        // Subtract 5 seconds from the LocalDateTime
        LocalDateTime newDateTime = dateTime.minusSeconds(5);
        System.out.println("LocalDateTime after subtracting 5 seconds: " + newDateTime);
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create a `LocalDateTime` object representing the current date and time. Then, we subtract 5 seconds from this date and time using the `minusSeconds` method. The result is a new `LocalDateTime` object representing the date and time 5 seconds earlier than the original.

Here is the full description of the method: 


until
public long until(Temporal endExclusive,
                  TemporalUnit unit)
Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.
 
 This calculates the amount of time between two LocalDateTime
 objects in terms of a single TemporalUnit.
 The start and end points are this and the specified date-time.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 The Temporal passed to this method is converted to a
 LocalDateTime using from(TemporalAccessor).
 For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
 using startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS).
 
 The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 complete units between the two date-times.
 For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00 and 2012-08-14T23:59
 will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.
 
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method.
 The second is to use TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal):
 
   // these two lines are equivalent
   amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
   amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
 
 The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
 
 The calculation is implemented in this method for ChronoUnit.
 The units NANOS, MICROS, MILLIS, SECONDS,
 MINUTES, HOURS and HALF_DAYS, DAYS,
 WEEKS, MONTHS, YEARS, DECADES,
 CENTURIES, MILLENNIA and ERAS are supported.
 Other ChronoUnit values will throw an exception.
 
 If the unit is not a ChronoUnit, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)
 passing this as the first argument and the converted input temporal
 as the second argument.
 
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

Specified by:
until in interface Temporal
Parameters:
endExclusive - the end date, exclusive, which is converted to a LocalDateTime, not null
unit - the unit to measure the amount in, not null
Returns:
the amount of time between this date-time and the end date-time
Throws:
DateTimeException - if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end
  temporal cannot be converted to a LocalDateTime
UnsupportedTemporalTypeException - if the unit is not supported
ArithmeticException - if numeric overflow occurs

Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.
 
 This returns a LocalDateTime, based on this one, with the value
 for the specified field changed.
 This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
 If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for

 In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
 such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
 In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
 the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.
 
 If the field is a ChronoField then the adjustment is implemented here.
 The supported fields will behave as per

Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.
 
 This returns a LocalDateTime, based on this one, with the value
 for the specified field changed.
 This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
 If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
 some other reason, an exception is thrown.
 
 In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
 such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
 In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
 the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.
 
 If the field is a ChronoField then the adjustment is implemented here.
 The supported fields will behave as per
 the matching method on LocalDate
 or LocalTime.
 All other ChronoField instances will throw an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException.
 
 If the field is not a ChronoField, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)
 passing this as the argument. In this case, the field determines
 whether and how to adjust the instant.
 
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

Specified by:

Parameters:
field - the field to set in the result, not null
newValue - the new value of the field in the result
Returns:
a LocalDateTime based on this with the specified field set, not null
Throws:
DateTimeException - if the field cannot be set
UnsupportedTemporalTypeException - if the field is not supported
ArithmeticException - if numeric overflow occurs

Here is an example of how to use the `with(TemporalField field, long newValue)` method from `java.time.LocalDateTime`:

```java

import java.time.temporal.ChronoField;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now();
        System.out.println("Original date-time: " + dateTime);

        System.out.println("New date-time with year 2022: " + newDateTime);
    }
}
```

In this example, we first create a `LocalDateTime` object for the current date and time. Then, we use the `with(TemporalField field, long newValue)` method to create a new `LocalDateTime` object with the year set to 2022. The original `LocalDateTime` object remains unchanged.

Here is the full description of the method: 


with
public LocalDateTime with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)
Returns an adjusted copy of this date-time.
 
 This returns a LocalDateTime, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
 The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
 Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
 
 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 TemporalAdjusters.
 These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
 Key date-time classes also implement the TemporalAdjuster interface,
 such as Month and MonthDay.
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 
 For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
 
  import static java.time.Month.*;
  import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

  result = localDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
 

 The classes LocalDate and LocalTime implement TemporalAdjuster,
 thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:
 
  result = localDateTime.with(date);
  result = localDateTime.with(time);
 

 The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
 TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal) method on the
 specified adjuster passing this as the argument.
 
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

In this example, we first create a `LocalDateTime` object representing the current date and time. We then print this original `LocalDateTime`.

Next, we adjust the `LocalDateTime` to the last day of the month using the `with(TemporalAdjuster adjuster)` method. The `TemporalAdjusters.lastDayOfMonth()` method is used as the `TemporalAdjuster`, which adjusts the date to the last day of the month.

Finally, we print the adjusted `LocalDateTime`.

In this code snippet, we import the `MonthDay` class from the `java.time` package. Then, we call the `now()` method to get the current month-day. Finally, we print the result.

Please note that the `now()` method returns the current date and time in the system's default time zone. If you want to get the current date and time in a specific time zone, you can use the `now(ZoneId zone)` method instead.

multipliedBy
public Period multipliedBy(int scalar)
Returns a new instance with each element in this period multiplied
 by the specified scalar.
 
 This returns a period with each of the years, months and days units
 individually multiplied.
 For example, a period of "2 years, -3 months and 4 days" multiplied by
 3 will return "6 years, -9 months and 12 days".
 No normalization is performed.

Specified by:
multipliedBy in interface ChronoPeriod
Parameters:
scalar - the scalar to multiply by, not null
Returns:
a Period based on this period with the amounts multiplied by the scalar, not null
Throws:
ArithmeticException - if numeric overflow occurs

Here is an example of how to use the `multipliedBy` method from the `java.time.Period` class:

```java
import java.time.Period;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Period period = Period.of(2, -3, 4);
        Period multipliedPeriod = period.multipliedBy(3);
        System.out.println(multipliedPeriod);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `Period` object with 2 years, -3 months, and 4 days. Then we call the `multipliedBy` method on this period, passing in the scalar 3. The result is a new `Period` object with each of the years, months, and days units individually multiplied by 3.

The output of this program will be: `P6Y-9M12D`, which represents 6 years, -9 months, and 12 days.

                               ZoneId zone)
Obtains an instance of ZonedDateTime from a year, month, day,
 hour, minute, second, nanosecond and time-zone.
 
 This creates a zoned date-time matching the local date-time of the seven
 specified fields as closely as possible.
 Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
 is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.
 
 The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
 This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
 date-time as defined by the rules of the zone ID.

 In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
 In the case of an overlap, when clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
 This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to "summer".
 
 In the case of a gap, when clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
 Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
 For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
 moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to "summer".
 
 This method exists primarily for writing test cases.
 Non test-code will typically use other methods to create an offset time.
 LocalDateTime has five additional convenience variants of the
 equivalent factory method taking fewer arguments.
 They are not provided here to reduce the footprint of the API.

Parameters:
year - the year to represent, from MIN_YEAR to MAX_YEAR
month - the month-of-year to represent, from 1 (January) to 12 (December)
dayOfMonth - the day-of-month to represent, from 1 to 31
hour - the hour-of-day to represent, from 0 to 23
minute - the minute-of-hour to represent, from 0 to 59
second - the second-of-minute to represent, from 0 to 59
nanoOfSecond - the nano-of-second to represent, from 0 to 999,999,999
zone - the time-zone, not null
Returns:
the offset date-time, not null
Throws:
DateTimeException - if the value of any field is out of range, or

Here is the full description of the method: 


withNano
public ZonedDateTime withNano(int nanoOfSecond)
Returns a copy of this ZonedDateTime with the nano-of-second altered.
 
 This operates on the local time-line,
 changing the time of the local date-time.
 This is then converted back to a ZonedDateTime, using the zone ID
 to obtain the offset.
 
 When converting back to ZonedDateTime, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
 then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
 If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.
 
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

Parameters:
nanoOfSecond - the nano-of-second to set in the result, from 0 to 999,999,999
Returns:
a ZonedDateTime based on this date-time with the requested nanosecond, not null
Throws:
DateTimeException - if the nano value is invalid

withZoneSameInstant
public ZonedDateTime withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId zone)
Returns a copy of this date-time with a different time-zone,

 This method changes the time-zone and retains the instant.
 This normally results in a change to the local date-time.
 
 This method is based on retaining the same instant, thus gaps and overlaps
 in the local time-line have no effect on the result.
 
 To change the offset while keeping the local time,
 use withZoneSameLocal(ZoneId).

Specified by:
withZoneSameInstant in interface ChronoZonedDateTime<LocalDate>
Parameters:

In this example, we first create a `ZonedDateTime` object for the current date and time in Paris time zone. Then we add 10 seconds to this date and time using the `plusSeconds` method and print the result.

Please note that the `plusSeconds` method may cause the local date-time to change by an amount other than one second, as it operates on the instant time-line.

In this code, we first create a `ZonedDateTime` object `zdt` using the current date and time in the "Europe/Paris" time zone. Then we use the `plusNanos(long nanos)` method to create a new `ZonedDateTime` object `zdtPlusNanos` that is 1 billion nanoseconds later than `zdt`. Finally, we print both `zdt` and `zdtPlusNanos` to the console.

Please note that the actual output will depend on the current date and time in the "Europe/Paris" time zone.

 The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
 Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
 
 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 TemporalAdjusters.
 These include finding the "last day of the month" and "next Wednesday".
 Key date-time classes also implement the TemporalAdjuster interface,
 such as Month and MonthDay.
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 
 For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
 
  import static java.time.Month.*;
  import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

  result = zonedDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
 

 The classes LocalDate and LocalTime implement TemporalAdjuster,
 thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:
 
  result = zonedDateTime.with(date);
  result = zonedDateTime.with(time);
 

ZoneOffset also implements TemporalAdjuster however using it
 as an argument typically has no effect. The offset of a ZonedDateTime is
 controlled primarily by the time-zone. As such, changing the offset does not generally
 make sense, because there is only one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
 If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
 to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.
 
 The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
 TemporalAdjuster.adjustInto(Temporal) method on the
 specified adjuster passing this as the argument.
 
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

Specified by:

Parameters:
adjuster - the adjuster to use, not null
Returns:
a ZonedDateTime based on this with the adjustment made, not null

Here is the description of the class: A date-time with a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as 2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris.
Here is the full description of the method: 


with
public ZonedDateTime with(TemporalField field,
                          long newValue)
Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.
 
 This returns a ZonedDateTime, based on this one, with the value
 for the specified field changed.
 This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
 If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
 some other reason, an exception is thrown.
 
 In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
 such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
 In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
 the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.
 
 If the field is a ChronoField then the adjustment is implemented here.
 
 The INSTANT_SECONDS field will return a date-time with the specified instant.
 The zone and nano-of-second are unchanged.
 The result will have an offset derived from the new instant and original zone.
 If the new instant value is outside the valid range then a DateTimeException will be thrown.
 
 The OFFSET_SECONDS field will typically be ignored.
 The offset of a ZonedDateTime is controlled primarily by the time-zone.
 As such, changing the offset does not generally make sense, because there is only
 one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
 If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
 to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.
 If the new offset value is outside the valid range then a DateTimeException will be thrown.
 
 The other supported fields will behave as per
 the matching method on LocalDateTime.
 The zone is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.
 When converting back to ZonedDateTime, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
 then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
 If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.
 
 All other ChronoField instances will throw an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException.
 
 If the field is not a ChronoField, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)
 passing this as the argument. In this case, the field determines
 whether and how to adjust the instant.
 
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

Here is the full description of the method: 


of
public static ZoneId of(String zoneId)
Obtains an instance of ZoneId from an ID ensuring that the
 ID is valid and available for use.
 
 This method parses the ID producing a ZoneId or ZoneOffset.
 A ZoneOffset is returned if the ID is 'Z', or starts with '+' or '-'.
 The result will always be a valid ID for which ZoneRules can be obtained.
 
 Parsing matches the zone ID step by step as follows.
 
If the zone ID equals 'Z', the result is ZoneOffset.UTC.
 If the zone ID consists of a single letter, the zone ID is invalid
  and DateTimeException is thrown.
 If the zone ID starts with '+' or '-', the ID is parsed as a
  ZoneOffset using ZoneOffset.of(String).
 If the zone ID equals 'GMT', 'UTC' or 'UT' then the result is a ZoneId
  with the same ID and rules equivalent to ZoneOffset.UTC.
 If the zone ID starts with 'UTC+', 'UTC-', 'GMT+', 'GMT-', 'UT+' or 'UT-'
  then the ID is a prefixed offset-based ID. The ID is split in two, with
  a two or three letter prefix and a suffix starting with the sign.
  The suffix is parsed as a ZoneOffset.
  The result will be a ZoneId with the specified UTC/GMT/UT prefix
  and the normalized offset ID as per ZoneOffset.getId().
  The rules of the returned ZoneId will be equivalent to the
  parsed ZoneOffset.
 All other IDs are parsed as region-based zone IDs. Region IDs must
  match the regular expression [A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9~/._+-]+
  otherwise a DateTimeException is thrown. If the zone ID is not
  in the configured set of IDs, ZoneRulesException is thrown.
  The detailed format of the region ID depends on the group supplying the data.
  The default set of data is supplied by the IANA Time Zone Database (TZDB).
  This has region IDs of the form '{area}/{city}', such as 'Europe/Paris' or 'America/New_York'.
  This is compatible with most IDs from TimeZone.
 

Parameters:
zoneId - the time-zone ID, not null
Returns:
the zone ID, not null
