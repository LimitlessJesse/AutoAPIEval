Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `getInit()` method from `java.lang.management.MemoryUsage`:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MemoryMXBean memoryMXBean = ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean();

        long init = memoryUsage.getInit();
        System.out.println("Initial size of memory in bytes: " + init);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are using the `ManagementFactory.getMemoryMXBean()` method to get the `MemoryMXBean` instance. Then we are using the `getHeapMemoryUsage()` method to get the `MemoryUsage` instance representing the heap memory usage. Finally, we are calling the `getInit()` method on the `MemoryUsage` instance to get the initial size of memory in bytes.

Please note that the `getInit()` method returns the initial size of memory in bytes that the Java virtual machine initially requests from the operating system for memory management. This method returns -1 if the initial memory size is undefined.

In this code snippet, we are using the `ManagementFactory` to get the `MemoryMXBean`, which provides access to the system's memory management MXBeans. We then get the `MemoryUsage` of the heap memory and call the `getMax()` method to get the maximum amount of memory in bytes that can be used for memory management.

Please note that the `getMax()` method returns -1 if the maximum memory size is undefined. This means that the maximum memory size is not known or is not applicable to the specific memory pool.

Here is the full description of the method: 


getStackTrace
public StackTraceElement[] getStackTrace()
Returns the stack trace of the thread
 associated with this ThreadInfo.
 If no stack trace was requested for this thread info, this method
 will return a zero-length array.
 If the returned array is of non-zero length then the first element of
 the array represents the top of the stack, which is the most recent
 method invocation in the sequence.  The last element of the array
 represents the bottom of the stack, which is the least recent method
 invocation in the sequence.

 Some Java virtual machines may, under some circumstances, omit one
 or more stack frames from the stack trace.  In the extreme case,
 a virtual machine that has no stack trace information concerning
 the thread associated with this ThreadInfo
 is permitted to return a zero-length array from this method.

Returns:
an array of StackTraceElement objects of the thread.

This code snippet uses the `getAllThreadIds()` method to get all thread IDs, and then uses the `getThreadInfo()` method to get the `ThreadInfo` for each thread ID. It then prints the thread ID, thread name, and stack trace for each thread.

Please note that the `getStackTrace()` method returns the stack trace of the thread associated with this `ThreadInfo`. If no stack trace was requested for this thread info, this method will return a zero-length array. If the returned array is of non-zero length, the first element of the array represents the top of the stack, which is the most recent method invocation in the sequence, and the last element of the array represents the bottom of the stack, which is the least recent method invocation in the sequence.
