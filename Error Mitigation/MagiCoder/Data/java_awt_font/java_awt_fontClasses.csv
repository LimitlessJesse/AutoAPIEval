FontRenderContext,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/FontRenderContext.html,The FontRenderContext class is a container for the information needed to correctly measure text.
GlyphJustificationInfo,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/GlyphJustificationInfo.html,The GlyphJustificationInfo class represents information about the justification properties of a glyph.
GlyphMetrics,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/GlyphMetrics.html,The GlyphMetrics class represents information for a single glyph.
GlyphVector,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/GlyphVector.html,A GlyphVector object is a collection of glyphs containing geometric information for the placement of each glyph in a transformed coordinate space which corresponds to the device on which the GlyphVector is ultimately displayed.
GraphicAttribute,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/GraphicAttribute.html,This class is used with the CHAR_REPLACEMENT attribute.
ImageGraphicAttribute,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/ImageGraphicAttribute.html,The ImageGraphicAttribute class is an implementation of GraphicAttribute which draws images in a TextLayout.
LayoutPath,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/LayoutPath.html,LayoutPath provides a mapping between locations relative to the baseline and points in user space.
LineBreakMeasurer,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/LineBreakMeasurer.html,The LineBreakMeasurer class allows styled text to be broken into lines (or segments) that fit within a particular visual advance.
LineMetrics,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/LineMetrics.html,The LineMetrics class allows access to the metrics needed to layout characters along a line and to layout of a set of lines.
NumericShaper,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/NumericShaper.html,The NumericShaper class is used to convert Latin-1 (European) digits to other Unicode decimal digits.
ShapeGraphicAttribute,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/ShapeGraphicAttribute.html,The ShapeGraphicAttribute class is an implementation of GraphicAttribute that draws shapes in a TextLayout.
TextAttribute,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/TextAttribute.html,The TextAttribute class defines attribute keys and attribute values used for text rendering.
TextHitInfo,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/TextHitInfo.html,"The TextHitInfo class represents a character position in a text model, and a bias, or ""side,"" of the character."
TextLayout,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/TextLayout.html,TextLayout is an immutable graphical representation of styled character data.
TextLayout.CaretPolicy,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/TextLayout.CaretPolicy.html,Defines a policy for determining the strong caret location.
TextMeasurer,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/TextMeasurer.html,"The TextMeasurer class provides the primitive operations needed for line break: measuring up to a given advance, determining the advance of a range of characters, and generating a TextLayout for a range of characters."
TransformAttribute,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/font/TransformAttribute.html,The TransformAttribute class provides an immutable wrapper for a transform so that it is safe to use as an attribute.
