Here is the full description of the method: 


setWriter
public void setWriter(Writer writer)
Set the writer that is to receive the result.  Normally,
 a stream should be used rather than a writer, so that
 the transformer may use instructions contained in the
 transformation instructions to control the encoding.  However,
 there are times when it is useful to write to a writer,
 such as when using a StringWriter.

Parameters:
writer - A valid Writer reference.

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");

Here is a complete code snippet of the `setWriter` method from `javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamResult`:

```java
import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamResult;
import java.io.StringWriter;
import java.io.Writer;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StreamResult result = new StreamResult();
        Writer writer = new StringWriter();
        result.setWriter(writer);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `StreamResult` object. Then, we create a `StringWriter` object, which is a type of `Writer`. We then call the `setWriter` method on the `StreamResult` object, passing in the `StringWriter` object.

This code snippet does not actually do anything useful, as it just sets a writer on a `StreamResult` object. The `StreamResult` object is not used in any way. It's just an example of how to use the `setWriter` method.

setOutputStream
public void setOutputStream(OutputStream outputStream)
Set the ByteStream that is to be written to.  Normally,
 a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that
 the transformer may use instructions contained in the
 transformation instructions to control the encoding.

In this code snippet, we are creating a new `OutputStream` that writes to a file named "output.txt". We then create a new `StreamResult` object that uses this `OutputStream`. Finally, we call the `setOutputStream` method on the `StreamResult` object, passing in the `OutputStream`.

Please note that you need to handle exceptions properly in a real-world application. In this example, we are just printing the stack trace of the exception to the console.

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(String systemId)
Set the systemID that may be used in association

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StreamResult streamResult = new StreamResult();

In this code snippet, we first create a new `StreamResult` object. Then we call the `getOutputStream()` method on this object, which returns an `OutputStream`.

Please note that this method will return `null` if the `OutputStream` was not set before. If you want to set an `OutputStream`, you can use the `setOutputStream()` method.

Here is an example of how to set an `OutputStream`:

```java
import javax.xml.transform.stream.StreamResult;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

            OutputStream outputStream = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
            streamResult.setOutputStream(outputStream);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a new `FileOutputStream` that writes to a file named "output.txt". We then set this `OutputStream` as the output stream for the `StreamResult` object.
