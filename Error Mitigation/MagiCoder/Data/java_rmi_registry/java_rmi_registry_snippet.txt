@@ Context
Here is the description of the package: Provides a class and two interfaces for the RMI registry.
Here is the description of the class: LocateRegistry is used to obtain a reference to a bootstrap remote object registry on a particular host (including the local host), or to create a remote object registry that accepts calls on a specific port.
Here is the full description of the method: 


getRegistry
public static Registry getRegistry(String host)
                            throws RemoteException
Returns a reference to the remote object Registry on the
 specified host on the default registry port of 1099.  If
 host is null, the local host is used.

Parameters:
host - host for the remote registry
Returns:
reference (a stub) to the remote object registry
Throws:
RemoteException - if the reference could not be created
Since:
JDK1.1

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");

Here is a complete code snippet of the method `getRegistry` from the `LocateRegistry` class:

```java
import java.rmi.Naming;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry("localhost");
            System.out.println("Registry found: " + registry);
        } catch (RemoteException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are using the `LocateRegistry.getRegistry` method to get a reference to the remote object registry on the specified host. If the host is null, the local host is used.

The `getRegistry` method returns a reference (a stub) to the remote object registry. If the reference could not be created, a `RemoteException` is thrown.

The `try-catch` block is used to handle the `RemoteException` that may be thrown by the `getRegistry` method. If an exception is thrown, it is caught and its stack trace is printed to the standard error stream.

Here is the full description of the method: 


createRegistry
public static Registry createRegistry(int port)
                               throws RemoteException
Creates and exports a Registry instance on the local
 host that accepts requests on the specified port.

 The Registry instance is exported as if the static
 UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject method is invoked, passing the
 Registry instance and the specified port as
 arguments, except that the Registry instance is
 exported with a well-known object identifier, an ObjID
 instance constructed with the value ObjID.REGISTRY_ID.

Parameters:
port - the port on which the registry accepts requests
Returns:
the registry
Throws:
RemoteException - if the registry could not be exported
Since:
JDK1.1

Here is a complete code snippet of the `createRegistry` method from `java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry`:

```java

import java.rmi.registry.Registry;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {

        } catch (RemoteException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are creating a Registry instance on the local host that accepts requests on the port 1099. If the Registry instance is successfully created, a message "Registry created successfully" will be printed. If an exception occurs (for example, if the Registry could not be exported), the exception will be printed to the console.
