fromCIEXYZ
public abstract float[] fromCIEXYZ(float[] colorvalue)
Transforms a color value assumed to be in the CS_CIEXYZ conversion
 color space into this ColorSpace.
 
 This method transforms color values using relative colorimetry,
 as defined by the International Color Consortium standard.  This
 means that the XYZ argument values taken by this method are represented
 relative to the D50 white point of the CS_CIEXYZ color space.
 This representation is useful in a two-step color conversion
 process in which colors are transformed from an input color
 space to CS_CIEXYZ and then to an output color space.  The color
 values returned by this method are not those that would produce
 the XYZ value passed to the method when measured by a colorimeter.
 If you have XYZ values corresponding to measurements made using
 current CIE recommended practices, they must be converted to D50
 relative values before being passed to this method.
 See the fromCIEXYZ method of
 ICC_ColorSpace for further information.
 

Parameters:
colorvalue - a float array with length of at least 3
Returns:
a float array with length equal to the number of
         components in this ColorSpace
Throws:
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException - if array length is not
         at least 3

In this code snippet, we first create a float array `colorvalue` with three elements. We then get an instance of the `ColorSpace` class with the `CS_LINEAR_RGB` color space.

Please note that the `fromCIEXYZ` method is not a static method, so you need to first get an instance of the `ColorSpace` class before you can call this method. The `CS_LINEAR_RGB` color space is just an example, you can replace it with any other color space you want to use.

Here is the full description of the method: 


fromCIEXYZ
public float[] fromCIEXYZ(float[] colorvalue)
Transforms a color value assumed to be in the CS_CIEXYZ conversion
 color space into this ColorSpace.
 
 This method transforms color values using relative colorimetry,
 as defined by the ICC Specification.  This
 means that the XYZ argument values taken by this method are represented
 relative to the D50 white point of the CS_CIEXYZ color space.
 This representation is useful in a two-step color conversion
 process in which colors are transformed from an input color
 space to CS_CIEXYZ and then to an output color space.  The color
 values returned by this method are not those that would produce
 the XYZ value passed to the method when measured by a colorimeter.
 If you have XYZ values corresponding to measurements made using
 current CIE recommended practices, they must be converted to D50
 relative values before being passed to this method.
 The paragraphs below explain this in more detail.
 
 The ICC standard uses a device independent color space (DICS) as the
 mechanism for converting color from one device to another device.  In
 this architecture, colors are converted from the source device's color
 space to the ICC DICS and then from the ICC DICS to the destination
 device's color space.  The ICC standard defines device profiles which
 contain transforms which will convert between a device's color space
 and the ICC DICS.  The overall conversion of colors from a source
 device to colors of a destination device is done by connecting the
 device-to-DICS transform of the profile for the source device to the
 DICS-to-device transform of the profile for the destination device.
 For this reason, the ICC DICS is commonly referred to as the profile
 connection space (PCS).  The color space used in the methods
 toCIEXYZ and fromCIEXYZ is the CIEXYZ PCS defined by the ICC
 Specification.  This is also the color space represented by
 ColorSpace.CS_CIEXYZ.
 
 The XYZ values of a color are often represented as relative to some
 white point, so the actual meaning of the XYZ values cannot be known
 without knowing the white point of those values.  This is known as
 relative colorimetry.  The PCS uses a white point of D50, so the XYZ
 values of the PCS are relative to D50.  For example, white in the PCS
 will have the XYZ values of D50, which is defined to be X=.9642,
 Y=1.000, and Z=0.8249.  This white point is commonly used for graphic
 arts applications, but others are often used in other applications.
 
 To quantify the color characteristics of a device such as a printer
 or monitor, measurements of XYZ values for particular device colors
 are typically made.  For purposes of this discussion, the term
 device XYZ values is used to mean the XYZ values that would be
 measured from device colors using current CIE recommended practices.
 
 Converting between device XYZ values and the PCS XYZ values taken as
 arguments by this method corresponds to converting between the device's
 color space, as represented by CIE colorimetric values, and the PCS.
 There are many factors involved in this process, some of which are quite
 subtle.  The most important, however, is the adjustment made to account
 for differences between the device's white point and the white point of
 the PCS.  There are many techniques for doing this and it is the
 subject of much current research and controversy.  Some commonly used
 methods are XYZ scaling, the von Kries transform, and the Bradford
 transform.  The proper method to use depends upon each particular
 application.
 
 The simplest method is XYZ scaling.  In this method each device XYZ
 value is  converted to a PCS XYZ value by multiplying it by the ratio
 of the PCS white point (D50) to the device white point.
 

 Xd, Yd, Zd are the device XYZ values
 Xdw, Ydw, Zdw are the device XYZ white point values
 Xp, Yp, Zp are the PCS XYZ values
 Xd50, Yd50, Zd50 are the PCS XYZ white point values

 Xp = Xd * (Xd50 / Xdw)
 Yp = Yd * (Yd50 / Ydw)
 Zp = Zd * (Zd50 / Zdw)

 

 Conversion from the PCS to the device would be done by inverting these
 equations:
 

 Xd = Xp * (Xdw / Xd50)
 Yd = Yp * (Ydw / Yd50)
 Zd = Zp * (Zdw / Zd50)

 

 Note that the media white point tag in an ICC profile is not the same
 as the device white point.  The media white point tag is expressed in
 PCS values and is used to represent the difference between the XYZ of
 device illuminant and the XYZ of the device media when measured under
 that illuminant.  The device white point is expressed as the device
 XYZ values corresponding to white displayed on the device.  For
 example, displaying the RGB color (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) on an sRGB device
 will result in a measured device XYZ value of D65.  This will not
 be the same as the media white point tag XYZ value in the ICC
 profile for an sRGB device.
