@@ Context
Here is the description of the package: Provides support for RMI Object Activation.
Here is the description of the class: An activation descriptor contains the information necessary to activate an object: the object's group identifier, the object's fully-qualified class name, the object's code location (the location of the class), a codebase URL path, the object's restart "mode", and, a "marshalled" object that can contain object specific initialization data.
Here is the full description of the method: 


getClassName
public String getClassName()
Returns the class name for the object specified by this
 descriptor.

Returns:
the class name
Since:
1.2

I want to learn how to use String getClassName() from java.rmi.activation.ActivationDesc
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);

Here is the complete code snippet of the method `getClassName()` from `java.rmi.activation.ActivationDesc`:

```java
import java.rmi.activation.ActivationDesc;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ActivationDesc desc = new ActivationDesc(null, "java.lang.String", null, null, null, null);
        String className = desc.getClassName();
        System.out.println(className);
    }
}
```

In this code, we create an instance of `ActivationDesc` and call the `getClassName()` method. The `getClassName()` method returns the class name of the object specified by this descriptor. In this case, it returns `java.lang.String`.

Here is the description of the package: Provides support for RMI Object Activation.
Here is the description of the class: The identifier for a registered activation group serves several purposes: identifies the group uniquely within the activation system, and contains a reference to the group's activation system so that the group can contact its activation system when necessary.
Here is the full description of the method: 


equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Compares two group identifiers for content equality.
 Returns true if both of the following conditions are true:
 1) the unique identifiers are equivalent (by content), and
 2) the activation system specified in each
    refers to the same remote object.

Overrides:
equals in class Object
Parameters:
obj - the Object to compare with
Returns:
true if these Objects are equal; false otherwise.
Since:
1.2

Here is a complete code snippet of the `equals(Object obj)` method from `java.rmi.activation.ActivationGroupID`:

```java

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ActivationGroupID id1 = new ActivationGroupID("group1", "system1");
        ActivationGroupID id2 = new ActivationGroupID("group1", "system1");
        ActivationGroupID id3 = new ActivationGroupID("group2", "system1");

        System.out.println(id1.equals(id2)); // true
        System.out.println(id1.equals(id3)); // false
    }
}
```

In this code, we create three `ActivationGroupID` objects. The first two are equal because they have the same group name and activation system. The third one is not equal because it has a different group name. The `equals(Object obj)` method compares the group names and activation systems of the two `ActivationGroupID` objects and returns `true` if they are equal and `false` otherwise.

The `hashCode()` method in `java.rmi.activation.ActivationGroupID` returns a hash code value for the object. This method is overridden from the `Object` class.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `hashCode()` method:

```java
import java.rmi.activation.ActivationGroupID;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ActivationGroupID groupID = new ActivationGroupID();
        int hashCode = groupID.hashCode();
        System.out.println("Hash code: " + hashCode);
    }
}
```

In this code, we create an instance of `ActivationGroupID` and call the `hashCode()` method on it. The hash code is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `ActivationGroupID` class is not part of the standard Java API and is likely a custom class you have created. The `hashCode()` method is a standard method in Java and is used to generate a unique hash code for an object.
