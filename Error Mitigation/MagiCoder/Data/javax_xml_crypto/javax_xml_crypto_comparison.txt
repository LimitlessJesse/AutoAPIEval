Sample: 0 KeySelector
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Context
Here is the description of the package Common classes for XML cryptography.
Here is the description of the class A selector that finds and returns a key using the data contained in a KeyInfo object.

@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.xml.crypto.KeySelector package from Java
Given the context, recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, 
Do not recommend methods inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
1. `KeySelectorResult select(KeyInfoCriteria criteria, Collection<KeySelector> keySelectors, XMLCryptoContext context)`: This method selects a key from the given collection of KeySelectors based on the criteria.

2. `KeySelectorResult select(KeyInfoCriteria criteria, KeySelector keySelector, XMLCryptoContext context)`: This method selects a key from the given KeySelector based on the criteria.

3. `KeySelectorResult select(KeyInfoCriteria criteria, KeySelector keySelector, XMLCryptoContext context, KeySelectorResult previousResult)`: This method selects a key from the given KeySelector based on the criteria, using the previous result as a hint.

4. `KeySelectorResult select(KeyInfoCriteria criteria, Collection<KeySelector> keySelectors, XMLCryptoContext context, KeySelectorResult previousResult)`: This method selects a key from the given collection of KeySelectors based on the criteria, using the previous result as a hint.

5. `KeySelectorResult select(KeyInfoCriteria criteria, KeySelector keySelector, XMLCryptoContext context, KeySelectorResult previousResult)`: This method selects a key from the given KeySelector based on the criteria, using the previous result as a hint.

@@ Response
1. `KeySelector.Purpose getPurpose()`: This method returns the purpose of the key that is to be selected.

2. `void select(KeyInfo keyInfo, Purpose purpose, AlgorithmMethod method, XMLCryptoContext context)`: This method selects a key from the given key information based on the specified purpose, algorithm method, and XML cryptography context.

3. `void select(KeySelector keySelector, KeyInfoCriteria criteria, XMLCryptoContext context)`: This method selects a key from the given key selector based on the specified criteria and XML cryptography context.

4. `void select(KeySelector keySelector, KeyInfoCriteria criteria, XMLCryptoContext context, List results)`: This method selects a key from the given key selector based on the specified criteria, XML cryptography context, and results list.

5. `void select(KeySelector keySelector, KeyInfoCriteria criteria, XMLCryptoContext context, List results, int startIndex)`: This method selects a key from the given key selector based on the specified criteria, XML cryptography context, results list, and start index.
