process
public abstract boolean process(Set<? extends TypeElement> annotations,
                                RoundEnvironment roundEnv)
Processes a set of annotation types on type elements
 originating from the prior round and returns whether or not
 these annotation types are claimed by this processor.  If true is returned, the annotation types are claimed and subsequent
 processors will not be asked to process them; if false
 is returned, the annotation types are unclaimed and subsequent
 processors may be asked to process them.  A processor may
 always return the same boolean value or may vary the result
 based on chosen criteria.

 The input set will be empty if the processor supports "*" and the root elements have no annotations.  A Processor must gracefully handle an empty set of annotations.

Specified by:
process in interface Processor
Parameters:
annotations - the annotation types requested to be processed
roundEnv - environment for information about the current and prior round
Returns:
whether or not the set of annotation types are claimed by this processor

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Here is a simple example of how you can use the `process` method from `javax.annotation.processing.AbstractProcessor`:

```java
import javax.annotation.processing.AbstractProcessor;
import javax.annotation.processing.RoundEnvironment;
import javax.lang.model.element.TypeElement;
import java.util.Set;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AbstractProcessor processor = new AbstractProcessor() {
            @Override
            public boolean process(Set<? extends TypeElement> annotations, RoundEnvironment roundEnv) {
                // Your processing logic here
                return false;
            }
        };

        // You can call the process method like this
        processor.process(null, null);
    }
}
```

In this example, we are creating an anonymous class that extends `AbstractProcessor` and overrides the `process` method. The `process` method is called with `null` as the `annotations` and `roundEnv` parameters.

Please replace the `// Your processing logic here` comment with your actual processing logic.

Note: The `process` method is abstract in `AbstractProcessor`, so you need to provide an implementation for it.

```

In this code snippet, `MyProcessor` is a subclass of `AbstractProcessor`. The `@SupportedAnnotationTypes("*")` annotation is used to specify that this processor supports all annotation types.

The `getSupportedAnnotationTypes` method is overridden to call the superclass method. This is because the superclass method returns the annotation types specified in the `@SupportedAnnotationTypes` annotation, if any. If no annotation types are specified, an empty set is returned.

The `getSupportedSourceVersion` method is also overridden to return the latest supported source version.

The `process` method is also overridden to perform the processing of the annotations. In this case, it does nothing and returns `false`.

Please note that this is a very basic example and does not actually do anything useful. It's just a demonstration of how to use the `getSupportedAnnotationTypes` method.

 always return the same boolean value or may vary the result
 based on chosen criteria.

 The input set will be empty if the processor supports "*" and the root elements have no annotations.  A Processor must gracefully handle an empty set of annotations.

Specified by:
process in interface Processor
Parameters:
annotations - the annotation types requested to be processed
roundEnv - environment for information about the current and prior round
Returns:
whether or not the set of annotation types are claimed by this processor




@@ Instruction
I want to learn how to use boolean process(Set<? extends TypeElement> annotations, RoundEnvironment roundEnv) from javax.annotation.processing.AbstractProcessor
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is a simple example of how you can use the `process` method from `javax.annotation.processing.AbstractProcessor`:

```java
import javax.annotation.processing.AbstractProcessor;
import javax.annotation.processing.RoundEnvironment;
import javax.lang.model.element.TypeElement;
import java.util.Set;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AbstractProcessor processor = new AbstractProcessor() {
            @Override
            public boolean process(Set<? extends TypeElement> annotations, RoundEnvironment roundEnv) {
                // Your processing logic here
                return false;
            }
        };

        // You can call the process method like this
        processor.process(null, null);
    }
}
```

In this example, we are creating an anonymous class that extends `AbstractProcessor` and overrides the `process` method. The `process` method is called with `null` as the `annotations` and `roundEnv` parameters.

Please replace the `// Your processing logic here` comment with your actual processing logic.

Note: The `process` method is abstract in `AbstractProcessor`, so you need to provide an implementation for it.
