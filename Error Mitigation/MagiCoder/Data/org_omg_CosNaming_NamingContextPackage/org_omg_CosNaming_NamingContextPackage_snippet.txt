Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

The `_write` method is not meant to be called directly. It is a part of the `Streamable` interface, which is used for marshalling and unmarshalling objects in the CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) framework.

The `Streamable` interface is used to define the methods for marshalling and unmarshalling objects. The `_write` method is used to write the object to an output stream, and the `_read` method is used to read the object from an input stream.

Here is an example of how you might use these methods in a CORBA application:

```java
import org.omg.CORBA.portable.OutputStream;
import org.omg.CORBA.portable.InputStream;
import org.omg.CORBA.portable.Streamable;

public class MyObject implements Streamable {
    private int value;

    public MyObject(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    @Override
    public void _write(OutputStream out) {
        out.write_long(value);
    }

    @Override
    public void _read(InputStream in) {
        value = in.read_long();
    }

    @Override
    public TypeCode _type() {
        return MyObjectHelper.type();
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyObject` is a class that implements the `Streamable` interface. The `_write` method writes the value of the `value` field to the output stream, and the `_read` method reads the value from the input stream.

The `_type` method is used to get the type code of the object.

Please note that this is a simplified example and may not work as expected in a real-world application. The actual usage of these methods would depend on the specifics of your CORBA application and the specifics of the `Streamable` interface you are using.

The `_read` method is a part of the `Streamable` interface, which is used for marshalling and unmarshalling data. It reads data from an `InputStream` and initializes the value field of the Holder with the unmarshalled data.

Here is a simple example of how you can use the `_read` method:

```java
import org.omg.CORBA.portable.InputStream;
import org.omg.CORBA.portable.OutputStream;
import org.omg.CosNaming.NamingContextPackage.NotFoundHolder;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NotFoundHolder holder = new NotFoundHolder();
        InputStream inputStream = new InputStream(); // Assume this is a valid InputStream
        holder._read(inputStream);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a new `NotFoundHolder` and an `InputStream`. We then call the `_read` method on the `NotFoundHolder`, passing the `InputStream` as the argument.

Please note that the `InputStream` and `NotFoundHolder` classes are not available in the standard Java library. They are part of the CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) and CosNaming packages, which are used for distributed object computing.

Also, the `_read` method is not a standard Java method. It is a part of the CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) and CosNaming packages, which are used for distributed object computing.
