@@ Context
Here is the description of the package A package of the Java Image I/O API dealing with low-level I/O fromfiles and streams.
Here is the description of the class An implementation of ImageInputStream that gets its input from a regular InputStream.

@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.imageio.stream.MemoryCacheImageInputStream package from Java
Given the context, recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, 
Do not recommend methods inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
1. `int read()`: This method reads the next byte of data from the input stream.
2. `int read(byte[] b)`: This method reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array b.
3. `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method reads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes.
4. `long skip(long n)`: This method skips over and discards n bytes of data from the input stream.
5. `int available()`: This method returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from the input stream without blocking.
6. `void close()`: This method closes the input stream and releases any system resources associated with it.
7. `boolean markSupported()`: This method tests if this input stream supports the mark and reset methods.
8. `void mark(int readlimit)`: This method is used to implement mark/reset functionality.
9. `void reset()`: This method resets the input stream to the last marked position.
10. `boolean readFully(byte[] b)`: This method reads the specified number of bytes from the input stream into the specified byte array.
11. `boolean readFully(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method reads the specified number of bytes from the input stream into the specified byte array starting at the specified offset.
12. `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method reads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes.
13. `int read()`: This method reads the next byte of data from the input stream.
14. `int read(byte[] b)`: This method reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array b.
