createDirectory
public static Path createDirectory(Path dir,

                            throws IOException
Creates a new directory. The check for the existence of the file and the
 creation of the directory if it does not exist are a single operation
 that is atomic with respect to all other filesystem activities that might
 affect the directory. The createDirectories
 method should be used where it is required to create all nonexistent
 parent directories first.

  The attrs parameter is optional file-attributes to set atomically when creating the directory. Each
 attribute is identified by its name. If more
 than one attribute of the same name is included in the array then all but
 the last occurrence is ignored.

Parameters:
dir - the directory to create
attrs - an optional list of file attributes to set atomically when
          creating the directory
Returns:
the directory
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException - if the array contains an attribute that cannot be set atomically
          when creating the directory
FileAlreadyExistsException - if a directory could not otherwise be created because a file of
          that name already exists (optional specific exception)
IOException - if an I/O error occurs or the parent directory does not exist
SecurityException - In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
          installed, the checkWrite
          method is invoked to check write access to the new directory.

copy
public static Path copy(Path source,
                        Path target,
                        CopyOption... options)
                 throws IOException
Copy a file to a target file.

  This method copies a file to the target file with the options parameter specifying how the copy is performed. By default, the
 copy fails if the target file already exists or is a symbolic link,
 except if the source and target are the same file, in
 which case the method completes without copying the file. File attributes
 are not required to be copied to the target file. If symbolic links are
 supported, and the file is a symbolic link, then the final target of the
 link is copied. If the file is a directory then it creates an empty
 directory in the target location (entries in the directory are not
 copied). This method can be used with the walkFileTree method to copy a directory and all entries in the directory,
 or an entire file-tree where required.

  The options parameter may include any of the following:

 
 Option Description 

 REPLACE_EXISTING 
 If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it
     is not a non-empty directory. If the target file exists and is a
     symbolic link, then the symbolic link itself, not the target of
     the link, is replaced. 


 COPY_ATTRIBUTES 
 Attempts to copy the file attributes associated with this file to
     the target file. The exact file attributes that are copied is platform
     and file system dependent and therefore unspecified. Minimally, the
     last-modified-time is
     copied to the target file if supported by both the source and target
     file stores. Copying of file timestamps may result in precision
     loss. 


 NOFOLLOW_LINKS 
 Symbolic links are not followed. If the file is a symbolic link,
     then the symbolic link itself, not the target of the link, is copied.
     It is implementation specific if file attributes can be copied to the
     new link. In other words, the COPY_ATTRIBUTES option may be
     ignored when copying a symbolic link. 


 An implementation of this interface may support additional
 implementation specific options.

  Copying a file is not an atomic operation. If an IOException
 is thrown, then it is possible that the target file is incomplete or some
 of its file attributes have not been copied from the source file. When
 the REPLACE_EXISTING option is specified and the target file
 exists, then the target file is replaced. The check for the existence of
 the file and the creation of the new file may not be atomic with respect
 to other file system activities.

  Usage Example:
 Suppose we want to copy a file into a directory, giving it the same file
 name as the source file:
 
     Path source = ...
     Path newdir = ...
     Files.copy(source, newdir.resolve(source.getFileName());
 

Parameters:
source - the path to the file to copy
target - the path to the target file (may be associated with a different
          provider to the source path)
options - options specifying how the copy should be done
Returns:
the path to the target file
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException - if the array contains a copy option that is not supported
FileAlreadyExistsException - if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the
          REPLACE_EXISTING option is not specified (optional
          specific exception)
DirectoryNotEmptyException - the REPLACE_EXISTING option is specified but the file
          cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory
          (optional specific exception)
IOException - if an I/O error occurs
SecurityException - In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
          installed, the checkRead
          method is invoked to check read access to the source file, the
          checkWrite is invoked
          to check write access to the target file. If a symbolic link is
          copied the security manager is invoked to check LinkPermission("symbolic").

move
public static Path move(Path source,
                        Path target,
                        CopyOption... options)
                 throws IOException
Move or rename a file to a target file.

  By default, this method attempts to move the file to the target
 file, failing if the target file exists except if the source and
 target are the same file, in which case this method
 has no effect. If the file is a symbolic link then the symbolic link
 itself, not the target of the link, is moved. This method may be
 invoked to move an empty directory. In some implementations a directory
 has entries for special files or links that are created when the
 directory is created. In such implementations a directory is considered
 empty when only the special entries exist. When invoked to move a
 directory that is not empty then the directory is moved if it does not
 require moving the entries in the directory.  For example, renaming a
 directory on the same FileStore will usually not require moving
 the entries in the directory. When moving a directory requires that its
 entries be moved then this method fails (by throwing an IOException). To move a file tree may involve copying rather
 than moving directories and this can be done using the copy method in conjunction with the Files.walkFileTree utility method.

  The options parameter may include any of the following:

 
 Option Description 

 REPLACE_EXISTING 
 If the target file exists, then the target file is replaced if it
     is not a non-empty directory. If the target file exists and is a
     symbolic link, then the symbolic link itself, not the target of
     the link, is replaced. 


 ATOMIC_MOVE 
 The move is performed as an atomic file system operation and all
     other options are ignored. If the target file exists then it is
     implementation specific if the existing file is replaced or this method
     fails by throwing an IOException. If the move cannot be
     performed as an atomic file system operation then AtomicMoveNotSupportedException is thrown. This can arise, for
     example, when the target location is on a different FileStore
     and would require that the file be copied, or target location is
     associated with a different provider to this object. 

 An implementation of this interface may support additional
 implementation specific options.

  Moving a file will copy the last-modified-time to the target
 file if supported by both source and target file stores. Copying of file
 timestamps may result in precision loss. An implementation may also
 attempt to copy other file attributes but is not required to fail if the
 file attributes cannot be copied. When the move is performed as
 a non-atomic operation, and an IOException is thrown, then the
 state of the files is not defined. The original file and the target file
 may both exist, the target file may be incomplete or some of its file
 attributes may not been copied from the original file.

  Usage Examples:
 Suppose we want to rename a file to "newname", keeping the file in the
 same directory:
 
     Path source = ...
     Files.move(source, source.resolveSibling("newname"));
 
 Alternatively, suppose we want to move a file to new directory, keeping
 the same file name, and replacing any existing file of that name in the
 directory:
 
     Path source = ...
     Path newdir = ...
     Files.move(source, newdir.resolve(source.getFileName()), REPLACE_EXISTING);
 

Parameters:
source - the path to the file to move
target - the path to the target file (may be associated with a different
          provider to the source path)
options - options specifying how the move should be done
Returns:
the path to the target file
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException - if the array contains a copy option that is not supported
FileAlreadyExistsException - if the target file exists but cannot be replaced because the
          REPLACE_EXISTING option is not specified (optional
          specific exception)
DirectoryNotEmptyException - the REPLACE_EXISTING option is specified but the file
          cannot be replaced because it is a non-empty directory
          (optional specific exception)
AtomicMoveNotSupportedException - if the options array contains the ATOMIC_MOVE option but
          the file cannot be moved as an atomic file system operation.
IOException - if an I/O error occurs
SecurityException - In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
          installed, the checkWrite
          method is invoked to check write access to both the source and
          target file.

exists
public static boolean exists(Path path,

 symbolic links are followed. If the option NOFOLLOW_LINKS is present then symbolic links are not followed.

  Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated. If this

 subsequence access will succeed. Care should be taken when using this
 method in security sensitive applications.

Parameters:

Returns:
true if the file exists; false if the file does

isHidden
public static boolean isHidden(Path path)
                        throws IOException
Tells whether or not a file is considered hidden. The exact
 definition of hidden is platform or provider dependent. On UNIX for
 example a file is considered to be hidden if its name begins with a
 period character ('.'). On Windows a file is considered hidden if it
 isn't a directory and the DOS hidden
 attribute is set.

  Depending on the implementation this method may require to access
 the file system to determine if the file is considered hidden.

Parameters:
path - the path to the file to test
Returns:
true if the file is considered hidden
Throws:
IOException - if an I/O error occurs
SecurityException - In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is
          installed, the checkRead
          method is invoked to check read access to the file.

Reads the value of a file attribute.

  The attribute parameter identifies the attribute to be read
 and takes the form:
 
 [view-name:]attribute-name

 where square brackets [...] delineate an optional component and the
 character ':' stands for itself.

  view-name is the name of a FileAttributeView that identifies a set of file attributes. If not
 specified then it defaults to "basic", the name of the file
 attribute view that identifies the basic set of file attributes common to
 many file systems. attribute-name is the name of the attribute.

  The options array may be used to indicate how symbolic links
 are handled for the case that the file is a symbolic link. By default,
 symbolic links are followed and the file attribute of the final target
 of the link is read. If the option NOFOLLOW_LINKS is present then symbolic links are not followed.

  Usage Example:
 Suppose we require the user ID of the file owner on a system that
 supports a "unix" view:

    int uid = (Integer)Files.getAttribute(path, "unix:uid");
 

Parameters:
path - the path to the file
attribute - the attribute to read
options - options indicating how symbolic links are handled
Returns:

Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException - if the attribute view is not available
IllegalArgumentException - if the attribute name is not specified or is not recognized
IOException - if an I/O error occurs
SecurityException - In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is

Return a Stream that is lazily populated with Path by walking the file tree rooted at a given starting file.  The
 file tree is traversed depth-first, the elements in the stream
 are Path objects that are obtained as if by resolving the relative path against start.

  This method works as if invoking it were equivalent to evaluating the
 expression:
 
 walk(start, Integer.MAX_VALUE, options)
 
 In other words, it visits all levels of the file tree.

  The returned stream encapsulates one or more DirectoryStreams.
 If timely disposal of file system resources is required, the
 try-with-resources construct should be used to ensure that the
 stream's close method is invoked after the stream
 operations are completed.  Operating on a closed stream will result in an
 IllegalStateException.

Parameters:
start - the starting file
options - options to configure the traversal
Returns:
the Stream of Path
Throws:
SecurityException - If the security manager denies access to the starting file.
          In the case of the default provider, the checkRead method is invoked

IOException - if an I/O error is thrown when accessing the starting file.

Creates a new link (directory entry) for an existing file (optional
 operation).

  The link parameter locates the directory entry to create.
 The existing parameter is the path to an existing file. This
 method creates a new directory entry for the file so that it can be
 accessed using link as the path. On some file systems this is
 known as creating a "hard link". Whether the file attributes are
 maintained for the file or for each directory entry is file system
 specific and therefore not specified. Typically, a file system requires
 that all links (directory entries) for a file be on the same file system.
 Furthermore, on some platforms, the Java virtual machine may require to
 be started with implementation specific privileges to create hard links
 or to create links to directories.

Parameters:
link - the link (directory entry) to create
existing - a path to an existing file
Returns:
the path to the link (directory entry)
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException - if the implementation does not support adding an existing file
          to a directory
FileAlreadyExistsException - if the entry could not otherwise be created because a file of

In this code snippet, replace `"/path/to/your/link"` with the actual path to your symbolic link. This code will print the target of the symbolic link.

Please note that you need to have the necessary permissions to read the symbolic link and the target file. If the target file does not exist, the `readSymbolicLink` method will return the path to the target file.

getPath
public abstract Path getPath(String first,
                             String... more)
Converts a path string, or a sequence of strings that when joined form
 a path string, to a Path. If more does not specify any
 elements then the value of the first parameter is the path string
 to convert. If more specifies one or more elements then each
 non-empty string, including first, is considered to be a sequence
 of name elements (see Path) and is joined to form a path string.
 The details as to how the Strings are joined is provider specific but
 typically they will be joined using the name-separator as the separator. For example, if the name separator is
 "/" and getPath("/foo","bar","gus") is invoked, then the
 path string "/foo/bar/gus" is converted to a Path.
 A Path representing an empty path is returned if first
 is the empty string and more does not contain any non-empty
 strings.

  The parsing and conversion to a path object is inherently
 implementation dependent. In the simplest case, the path string is rejected,
 and InvalidPathException thrown, if the path string contains
 characters that cannot be converted to characters that are legal
 to the file store. For example, on UNIX systems, the NUL (\u0000)
 character is not allowed to be present in a path. An implementation may
 choose to reject path strings that contain names that are longer than those
 allowed by any file store, and where an implementation supports a complex
 path syntax, it may choose to reject path strings that are badly
 formed.

  In the case of the default provider, path strings are parsed based
 on the definition of paths at the platform or virtual file system level.
 For example, an operating system may not allow specific characters to be
 present in a file name, but a specific underlying file store may impose
 different or additional restrictions on the set of legal
 characters.

  This method throws InvalidPathException when the path string
 cannot be converted to a path. Where possible, and where applicable,
 the exception is created with an index value indicating the first position in the path parameter
 that caused the path string to be rejected.

Parameters:
first - the path string or initial part of the path string
more - additional strings to be joined to form the path string
Returns:
the resulting Path
Throws:
InvalidPathException - If the path string cannot be converted

getRootDirectories
public abstract Iterable<Path> getRootDirectories()
Returns an object to iterate over the paths of the root directories.

  A file system provides access to a file store that may be composed
 of a number of distinct file hierarchies, each with its own top-level
 root directory. Unless denied by the security manager, each element in
 the returned iterator corresponds to the root directory of a distinct
 file hierarchy. The order of the elements is not defined. The file
 hierarchies may change during the lifetime of the Java virtual machine.
 For example, in some implementations, the insertion of removable media
 may result in the creation of a new file hierarchy with its own
 top-level directory.

  When a security manager is installed, it is invoked to check access
 to the each root directory. If denied, the root directory is not returned
 by the iterator. In the case of the default provider, the SecurityManager.checkRead(String) method is invoked to check read access
 to each root directory. It is system dependent if the permission checks
 are done when the iterator is obtained or during iteration.

Constructs a new file system that is identified by a URI
 This method iterates over the installed providers to locate the provider that is identified by the URI
 scheme of the given URI. URI schemes are compared
 without regard to case. The exact form of the URI is highly provider
 dependent. If found, the provider's newFileSystem(URI,Map) method is invoked to construct the new file system.

  Once a file system is closed it is
 provider-dependent if the provider allows a new file system to be created
 with the same URI as a file system it previously created.

  Usage Example:
 Suppose there is a provider identified by the scheme "memory"
 installed:
 
   Map<String,String> env = new HashMap<>();
   env.put("capacity", "16G");
   env.put("blockSize", "4k");
   FileSystem fs = FileSystems.newFileSystem(URI.create("memory:///?name=logfs"), env);
 

Parameters:
uri - the URI identifying the file system
env - a map of provider specific properties to configure the file system;
          may be empty
Returns:
a new file system
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the pre-conditions for the uri parameter are not met,
          or the env parameter does not contain properties required
          by the provider, or a property value is invalid
FileSystemAlreadyExistsException - if the file system has already been created
ProviderNotFoundException - if a provider supporting the URI scheme is not installed

 provider supporting the URI scheme is located then its newFileSystem(URI,Map) is
 invoked to construct the new file system.

Parameters:
uri - the URI identifying the file system
env - a map of provider specific properties to configure the file system;
          may be empty
loader - the class loader to locate the provider or null to only
          attempt to locate an installed provider
Returns:
a new file system
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the pre-conditions for the uri parameter are not met,
          or the env parameter does not contain properties required
          by the provider, or a property value is invalid
FileSystemAlreadyExistsException - if the URI scheme identifies an installed provider and the file
          system has already been created
ProviderNotFoundException - if a provider supporting the URI scheme is not found
ServiceConfigurationError - when an error occurs while loading a service provider
IOException - an I/O error occurs creating the file system
SecurityException - if a security manager is installed and it denies an unspecified
          permission required by the file system provider implementation




@@ Instruction
I want to learn how to use FileSystem newFileSystem(URI uri, Map<String,?> env, ClassLoader loader) from java.nio.file.FileSystems
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

@@ Response
Here is a complete code snippet of the `newFileSystem` method from `java.nio.file.FileSystems`:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URI;
import java.nio.file.*;
import java.util.Map;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            URI uri = URI.create("file:///C:/Users/user/Desktop");
            Map<String,?> env = new java.util.HashMap<>();
            ClassLoader loader = Main.class.getClassLoader();
            FileSystem fs = FileSystems.newFileSystem(uri, env, loader);
            System.out.println(fs);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are creating a new `FileSystem` object using the `newFileSystem` method. The `URI`, `Map`, and `ClassLoader` are passed as arguments to this method. The `URI` is the identifier of the file system, the `Map` is used to configure the file system, and the `ClassLoader` is used to locate the provider.

Please replace `"file:///C:/Users/user/Desktop"` with the actual URI of your file system.

Also, note that you need to have the necessary permissions to access the file system. If you don't have the necessary permissions, you will get a `SecurityException`.
