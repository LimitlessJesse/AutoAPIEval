add
public boolean add(E e)
Inserts the specified element at the tail of this queue if it is

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java

In this code snippet, we create an `ArrayBlockingQueue` of Strings with a capacity of 10. We then try to add a string "Hello" to the queue. If the queue is full, an `IllegalStateException` will be thrown. We catch this exception and print the stack trace to handle it.

Please note that the `add(E e)` method in `ArrayBlockingQueue` is not the same as the `add(E e)` method in `ArrayList`. The `add(E e)` method in `ArrayBlockingQueue` throws an `IllegalStateException` if the queue is full, while the `add(E e)` method in `ArrayList` simply returns `false`.

Here is an example of how to use the `get` method from `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentHashMap<String, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        map.put("key1", "value1");

        String value1 = map.get("key1");
        System.out.println("Value for key1: " + value1);

        // Get the value for key2
        String value2 = map.get("key2");
        System.out.println("Value for key2: " + value2);

        // Try to get a value for a non-existent key
        String value3 = map.get("key3");
        System.out.println("Value for key3: " + value3);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `ConcurrentHashMap` and add some key-value pairs to it. Then we use the `get` method to retrieve the values for the keys "key1" and "key2". If a key does not exist in the map, the `get` method returns `null`.

equals
public boolean equals(Object o)
Description copied from class: Object
Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.
 
 The equals method implements an equivalence relation
 on non-null object references:
 
It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value
     x, x.equals(x) should return
     true.
 It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values
     x and y, x.equals(y)
     should return true if and only if
     y.equals(x) returns true.
 It is transitive: for any non-null reference values
     x, y, and z, if
     x.equals(y) returns true and
     y.equals(z) returns true, then
     x.equals(z) should return true.
 It is consistent: for any non-null reference values
     x and y, multiple invocations of
     x.equals(y) consistently return true
     or consistently return false, provided no
     information used in equals comparisons on the
     objects is modified.
 For any non-null reference value x,
     x.equals(null) should return false.
 

 The equals method for class Object implements
 the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
 that is, for any non-null reference values x and
 y, this method returns true if and only
 if x and y refer to the same object
 (x == y has the value true).
 
 Note that it is generally necessary to override the hashCode
 method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
 general contract for the hashCode method, which states
 that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

Specified by:
equals in interface Collection<K>
Specified by:
equals in interface Set<K>
Overrides:
equals in class Object
Parameters:
o - the reference object with which to compare.
Returns:
true if this object is the same as the obj
          argument; false otherwise.

In this code, we first create a `ConcurrentHashMap` and add some keys to it. Then we get the `KeySetView` of the map. We remove all keys "A" and "B" from the map using the `removeAll(Collection<?> c)` method. The result of the removal operation is stored in the `result` variable. Finally, we print the remaining keys in the map.

public final Object[] toArray()
Description copied from interface: Collection
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection.
 If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements

 The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are

toArray
public final <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)
Description copied from interface: Collection
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection;
 the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
 If the collection fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
 Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
 specified array and the size of this collection.

 If this collection fits in the specified array with room to spare
 (i.e., the array has more elements than this collection), the element
 in the array immediately following the end of the collection is set to
 null.  (This is useful in determining the length of this
 collection only if the caller knows that this collection does
 not contain any null elements.)

 If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
 are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in
 the same order.

 Like the Collection.toArray() method, this method acts as bridge between
 array-based and collection-based APIs.  Further, this method allows
 precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
 under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

 Suppose x is a collection known to contain only strings.
 The following code can be used to dump the collection into a newly
 allocated array of String:

 
     String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);

 Note that toArray(new Object[0]) is identical in function to
 toArray().

Specified by:
toArray in interface Collection<E>
Type Parameters:
T - the runtime type of the array to contain the collection
Parameters:
a - the array into which the elements of this collection are to be
        stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the same
        runtime type is allocated for this purpose.
Returns:

equals
public boolean equals(Object o)
Description copied from class: Object
Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.
 
 The equals method implements an equivalence relation
 on non-null object references:
 
It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value
     x, x.equals(x) should return
     true.
 It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values
     x and y, x.equals(y)
     should return true if and only if
     y.equals(x) returns true.
 It is transitive: for any non-null reference values
     x, y, and z, if
     x.equals(y) returns true and
     y.equals(z) returns true, then
     x.equals(z) should return true.
 It is consistent: for any non-null reference values
     x and y, multiple invocations of
     x.equals(y) consistently return true
     or consistently return false, provided no
     information used in equals comparisons on the
     objects is modified.
 For any non-null reference value x,
     x.equals(null) should return false.
 

 The equals method for class Object implements
 the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
 that is, for any non-null reference values x and
 y, this method returns true if and only
 if x and y refer to the same object
 (x == y has the value true).
 
 Note that it is generally necessary to override the hashCode
 method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
 general contract for the hashCode method, which states
 that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

Specified by:
equals in interface Collection<K>
Specified by:

Overrides:

Parameters:

public final Object[] toArray()
Description copied from interface: Collection
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection.
 If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
 are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in

 The returned array will be "safe" in that no references to it are

toArray
public final <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)
Description copied from interface: Collection
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection;
 the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
 If the collection fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
 Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
 specified array and the size of this collection.

 If this collection fits in the specified array with room to spare
 (i.e., the array has more elements than this collection), the element
 in the array immediately following the end of the collection is set to
 null.  (This is useful in determining the length of this
 collection only if the caller knows that this collection does
 not contain any null elements.)

 If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
 are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in
 the same order.

 Like the Collection.toArray() method, this method acts as bridge between
 array-based and collection-based APIs.  Further, this method allows
 precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
 under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

 Suppose x is a collection known to contain only strings.
 The following code can be used to dump the collection into a newly
 allocated array of String:

 
     String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);

 Note that toArray(new Object[0]) is identical in function to
 toArray().

Specified by:
toArray in interface Collection<E>
Type Parameters:
T - the runtime type of the array to contain the collection
Parameters:
a - the array into which the elements of this collection are to be
        stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the same
        runtime type is allocated for this purpose.
Returns:
an array containing all of the elements in this collection

peek
public E peek()
Description copied from interface: Deque
Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue represented by
 this deque (in other words, the first element of this deque), or
 returns null if this deque is empty.

 This method is equivalent to Deque.peekFirst().

Here is a complete code snippet of the `peek()` method from `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedDeque`:

```java

In this code snippet, we first create a `ConcurrentLinkedDeque` object. Then we add two strings to the deque. Finally, we call the `peek()` method, which retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue represented by this deque. In this case, it will print "Hello" to the console.

```

In this code, we create a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` and add an element to it using the `add(E e)` method. The element is then printed to the console.

The `add(E e)` method is a part of the `Queue` interface, which is a part of the `Collection` framework in Java. It adds the specified element to the end of the queue.

The `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` is a thread-safe queue that allows multiple threads to add and remove elements concurrently. It is implemented using a linked list, and the `add(E e)` method is implemented to add the element at the end of the list.

The `add(E e)` method returns `true` if the element was added successfully, and `false` if the element was `null`. If the element is `null`, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `remove(Object o)` method from `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListSet`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListSet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentSkipListSet<String> set = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<>();
        set.add("Hello");

        set.remove("Hello");
        System.out.println("After removal: " + set);
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create a `ConcurrentSkipListSet` and add some elements to it. Then we print the set before and after removing an element. The `remove(Object o)` method returns `true` if the element was in the set and was removed, and `false` otherwise.

Here is the full description of the method: 


size
public int size()
Returns the number of elements in this set.  If this set
 contains more than Integer.MAX_VALUE elements, it
 returns Integer.MAX_VALUE.

 Beware that, unlike in most collections, this method is
 NOT a constant-time operation. Because of the
 asynchronous nature of these sets, determining the current
 number of elements requires traversing them all to count them.
 Additionally, it is possible for the size to change during
 execution of this method, in which case the returned result
 will be inaccurate. Thus, this method is typically not very
 useful in concurrent applications.

In this code, we create a `ConcurrentSkipListSet` and add two elements to it. Then we call the `size()` method to get the number of elements in the set and print it out.

Please note that the `size()` method is not a constant-time operation in a concurrent environment. It is designed to be used in a single-threaded environment. In a concurrent environment, it is recommended to use a `ConcurrentNavigableMap` or `ConcurrentNavigableSet` instead.

In this code, we first create a `CopyOnWriteArrayList` and add an element to it. Then we use the `set` method to replace the first element with "World". Finally, we print the list to verify that the element has been replaced.

Please note that `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is a thread-safe variant of `ArrayList`, which means that it can be used in a multi-threaded environment without the need for explicit synchronization. However, the `set` method is not thread-safe, so it should not be used in a multi-threaded environment where multiple threads can modify the list simultaneously.

Please note that the `toArray()` method in `CopyOnWriteArrayList` returns an array of `Object`, not `String`. This is because the `CopyOnWriteArrayList` is a thread-safe list that uses a copy-on-write strategy, which means that when we modify the list, it creates a new copy of the list and modifies the new copy. This is to prevent concurrent modification exceptions.

So, if you want to use the returned array as a `String` array, you need to cast each element to `String`:

```java
String[] array = (String[]) list.toArray();

Here is the full description of the method: 


toArray
public <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in
 proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime type of
 the returned array is that of the specified array.  If the list fits
 in the specified array, it is returned therein.  Otherwise, a new
 array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and
 the size of this list.

 If this list fits in the specified array with room to spare
 (i.e., the array has more elements than this list), the element in
 the array immediately following the end of the list is set to
 null.  (This is useful in determining the length of this
 list only if the caller knows that this list does not contain
 any null elements.)

 Like the toArray() method, this method acts as bridge between
 array-based and collection-based APIs.  Further, this method allows
 precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
 under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

 Suppose x is a list known to contain only strings.
 The following code can be used to dump the list into a newly
 allocated array of String:

    String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);

 Note that toArray(new Object[0]) is identical in function to
 toArray().

Specified by:
toArray in interface Collection<E>
Specified by:
toArray in interface List<E>
Type Parameters:
T - the runtime type of the array to contain the collection
Parameters:
a - the array into which the elements of the list are to
          be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the
          same runtime type is allocated for this purpose.
Returns:
an array containing all the elements in this list
Throws:
ArrayStoreException - if the runtime type of the specified array
         is not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in

We then call the `replaceAll` method on the list, passing in the operator. This will apply the operator to each element in the list, converting them to uppercase. Finally, we print out the original list and the list after the `replaceAll` operation.

Here is an example of how to use the `removeIf` method from `java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");

        list.removeIf(s -> s.startsWith("J"));

        System.out.println("After removing: " + list);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `CopyOnWriteArrayList` and add some strings to it. Then we use the `removeIf` method to remove all strings that start with 'J'. The `removeIf` method takes a `Predicate` as a parameter, which is a function that takes an input and returns a boolean. In this case, the `Predicate` checks if a string starts with 'J'. If it does, the string is removed.

The `System.out::println` is a method reference that is equivalent to `x -> System.out.println(x)`. It is a shorthand way to pass a method as a parameter to another method.

In this code snippet, we first create a `CopyOnWriteArraySet` and add some elements to it. Then we create a new `Collection` and add some elements to it. We then call the `removeAll(Collection<?> c)` method on the set and pass the collection as a parameter. The method removes all elements in the collection from the set and returns `true` if the set was modified.

toArray
public <T> T[] toArray(T[] a)
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set; the
 runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
 If the set fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.
 Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the
 specified array and the size of this set.

 If this set fits in the specified array with room to spare
 (i.e., the array has more elements than this set), the element in
 the array immediately following the end of the set is set to
 null.  (This is useful in determining the length of this
 set only if the caller knows that this set does not contain
 any null elements.)

 If this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements
 are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements
 in the same order.

 Like the toArray() method, this method acts as bridge between
 array-based and collection-based APIs.  Further, this method allows
 precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may,
 under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.

 Suppose x is a set known to contain only strings.
 The following code can be used to dump the set into a newly allocated
 array of String:

    String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]);

 Note that toArray(new Object[0]) is identical in function to
 toArray().

countDown
public void countDown()
Decrements the count of the latch, releasing all waiting threads if
 the count reaches zero.

 If the current count is greater than zero then it is decremented.
 If the new count is zero then all waiting threads are re-enabled for
 thread scheduling purposes.

 If the current count equals zero then nothing happens.

In this example, we create a `CountDownLatch` with a count of 3. We then start three threads, each of which sleeps for a different amount of time before calling `countDown()` on the latch. The `await()` method in the main thread waits until the count of the latch reaches zero, at which point it continues execution.

In this code, we create a `CountDownLatch` with a count of 3. We then start two threads, each of which sleeps for a different amount of time before calling `countDown()` on the `CountDownLatch`. After the threads have been started, we call `await()` on the `CountDownLatch`, which will block until the count reaches zero. Finally, we call `getCount()` to get the current count of the `CountDownLatch`.

await
public int await()
          throws InterruptedException,
                 BrokenBarrierException
Waits until all parties have invoked
 await on this barrier.

 If the current thread is not the last to arrive then it is
 disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
 one of the following things happens:
 
The last thread arrives; or
 Some other thread interrupts
 the current thread; or
 Some other thread interrupts
 one of the other waiting threads; or
 Some other thread times out while waiting for barrier; or
 Some other thread invokes reset() on this barrier.
 
If the current thread:
 
has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
 is interrupted while waiting
 
 then InterruptedException is thrown and the current thread's
 interrupted status is cleared.

 If the barrier is reset() while any thread is waiting,
 or if the barrier is broken when
 await is invoked, or while any thread is waiting, then
 BrokenBarrierException is thrown.

 If any thread is interrupted while waiting,
 then all other waiting threads will throw
 BrokenBarrierException and the barrier is placed in the broken
 state.

 If the current thread is the last thread to arrive, and a
 non-null barrier action was supplied in the constructor, then the
 current thread runs the action before allowing the other threads to
 continue.
 If an exception occurs during the barrier action then that exception
 will be propagated in the current thread and the barrier is placed in
 the broken state.

Returns:
the arrival index of the current thread, where index
         getParties() - 1 indicates the first
         to arrive and zero indicates the last to arrive
Throws:
InterruptedException - if the current thread was interrupted

BrokenBarrierException - if another thread was
         interrupted or timed out while the current thread was

Each thread then waits at the barrier and prints a message when it has crossed the barrier. If any thread is interrupted or times out while waiting, a `BrokenBarrierException` is thrown.

                 TimeoutException
Waits until all parties have invoked
 await on this barrier, or the specified waiting time elapses.

 If the current thread is not the last to arrive then it is
 disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until
 one of the following things happens:
 
The last thread arrives; or
 The specified timeout elapses; or
 Some other thread interrupts
 the current thread; or
 Some other thread interrupts
 one of the other waiting threads; or
 Some other thread times out while waiting for barrier; or
 Some other thread invokes reset() on this barrier.
 
If the current thread:
 
has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
 is interrupted while waiting
 
 then InterruptedException is thrown and the current thread's
 interrupted status is cleared.

 If the specified waiting time elapses then TimeoutException
 is thrown. If the time is less than or equal to zero, the
 method will not wait at all.

 If the barrier is reset() while any thread is waiting,
 or if the barrier is broken when
 await is invoked, or while any thread is waiting, then
 BrokenBarrierException is thrown.

 If any thread is interrupted while
 waiting, then all other waiting threads will throw BrokenBarrierException and the barrier is placed in the broken
 state.

 If the current thread is the last thread to arrive, and a
 non-null barrier action was supplied in the constructor, then the
 current thread runs the action before allowing the other threads to
 continue.
 If an exception occurs during the barrier action then that exception
 will be propagated in the current thread and the barrier is placed in
 the broken state.

Parameters:
timeout - the time to wait for the barrier
unit - the time unit of the timeout parameter
Returns:
the arrival index of the current thread, where index
         getParties() - 1 indicates the first
         to arrive and zero indicates the last to arrive
Throws:
InterruptedException - if the current thread was interrupted
         while waiting
TimeoutException - if the specified timeout elapses.
         In this case the barrier will be broken.
BrokenBarrierException - if another thread was
         interrupted or timed out while the current thread was
         waiting, or the barrier was reset, or the barrier was broken

The `DelayedElement` class implements the `Delayed` interface, which requires the `getDelay` and `compareTo` methods. The `getDelay` method returns the remaining delay in the specified time unit, and the `compareTo` method compares this object with the specified object for order.

The `main` method creates a `DelayQueue`, adds two `DelayedElement` objects to the queue, and then takes and prints the elements from the queue. The `DelayedElement` objects are printed in order of their delay.

In this code, we create a `DelayQueue` of `DelayedElement` objects. Each `DelayedElement` has a delay and a data field. The `take()` method will block until an element with an expired delay is available.

Please note that the `DelayQueue` is not thread-safe. If you need to use it in a multi-threaded environment, you should use `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock` or `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock` to ensure thread safety.

In this code, we create a `DelayQueue` of `DelayedElement` objects. Each `DelayedElement` has a delay and a data field. The `poll()` method retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue has no elements with an expired delay.

The `DelayedElement` class implements the `Delayed` interface, which requires the `getDelay()` and `compareTo()` methods. The `getDelay()` method returns the remaining delay associated with this object, in the given time unit. The `compareTo()` method is used to order the elements in the queue.

The `main()` method adds three `DelayedElement` objects to the queue, with different delays. It then repeatedly calls `poll()` and prints the data of the element if it is ready to be processed.

Waits for another thread to arrive at this exchange point (unless

 in return.

 If another thread is already waiting at the exchange point then
 it is resumed for thread scheduling purposes and receives the object

 If no other thread is already waiting at the exchange then the
 current thread is disabled for thread scheduling purposes and lies
 dormant until one of two things happens:
 
Some other thread enters the exchange; or
 Some other thread interrupts
 the current thread.
 
If the current thread:
 
has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or
 is interrupted while waiting
 for the exchange,
 
 then InterruptedException is thrown and the current thread's
 interrupted status is cleared.

Parameters:

In this code snippet, we create an `ExecutorService` and an `ExecutorCompletionService`. We then submit a task to the `ExecutorCompletionService`, which returns a `Future`. We then get the result of the task and print it. Finally, we shut down the `ExecutorService`.

Please note that the `submit` method is a blocking method, which means it will wait for the task to complete before it returns. If you want to use the `submit` method in a non-blocking way, you can use the `CompletableFuture` class instead.

 Calls to execute will reuse previously constructed

 not been used for sixty seconds are terminated and removed from
 the cache. Thus, a pool that remains idle for long enough will

        task.fork();

        Integer result = task.getRawResult();
        System.out.println(result);
    }

```

In this example, we create a `RecursiveTask` that always returns 1. We then fork this task and get the raw result. Note that this method is not typically used in normal programming, as it can be dangerous and can expose internal implementation details. It is mainly used for debugging and testing.

The `setRawResult(V value)` method is a protected method in the `java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinTask` class. It is used to set the raw result of the task. This method is designed to support extensions, and should not in general be called otherwise.

Here is a complete code snippet of this method:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction;

public class MyRecursiveAction extends RecursiveAction {
    private int start;
    private int end;
    private int[] data;

    public MyRecursiveAction(int start, int end, int[] data) {
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
        this.data = data;
    }

    @Override
    protected void compute() {
        if (end - start <= 10) {
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
                data[i] = data[i] * 2;
            }
        } else {
            int mid = (start + end) / 2;
            invokeAll(new MyRecursiveAction(start, mid, data), new MyRecursiveAction(mid, end, data));

    }

    @Override
    protected void setRawResult(Object value) {
        super.setRawResult(value);
    }

```

In this example, we create a `RecursiveAction` subclass `MyRecursiveAction`. This class overrides the `compute()` method to perform some computation, and the `setRawResult(Object value)` method to set the raw result.

Please note that the `setRawResult(Object value)` method is protected and should not be called directly. It is used by the ForkJoinPool to set the raw result of the task.

public boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)
Description copied from interface: Future
Attempts to cancel execution of this task.  This attempt will
 fail if the task has already completed, has already been cancelled,
 or could not be cancelled for some other reason. If successful,
 and this task has not started when cancel is called,
 this task should never run.  If the task has already started,

 whether the thread executing this task should be interrupted in
 an attempt to stop the task.

 After this method returns, subsequent calls to Future.isDone() will
 always return true.  Subsequent calls to Future.isCancelled()
 will always return true if this method returned true.

Specified by:

Parameters:
mayInterruptIfRunning - true if the thread executing this

In this code snippet, we create a `LinkedBlockingDeque` and add an element to it using the `add(E e)` method. The element is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `LinkedBlockingDeque` is a concurrent collection and the `add(E e)` method is used to add an element to the end of the deque. If the deque is full, an `IllegalStateException` will be thrown.

In this code, we create a `LinkedTransferQueue` and add an element to it. Then we try to transfer two elements to the queue. The first transfer is successful, so it returns `true`. The second transfer is not successful because there is no consumer waiting to receive the element, so it returns `false`.

        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a `PriorityBlockingQueue` and add two strings to it. Then we call the `take()` method, which retrieves and removes the head of this queue. If the queue is empty, the method will block until an element becomes available.

Please note that the `take()` method can throw an `InterruptedException` if the thread is interrupted while waiting for an element to become available. In the above code, we catch this exception and print the stack trace.

Here is a simple example of how to use the `compute()` method from `java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction`.

```java

    private final int end;

    public MyRecursiveAction(int start, int end) {
        this.start = start;
        this.end = end;
    }

    @Override
    protected void compute() {
        if (end - start <= 10) {
            // Base case: if the range is small enough, compute it directly
            for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
                // Perform some computation
                System.out.println("Computing " + i);

            MyRecursiveAction right = new MyRecursiveAction(mid, end);
            left.fork();
            right.compute();
            left.join();

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRecursiveAction action = new MyRecursiveAction(0, 100);
        action.compute();
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyRecursiveAction` is a subclass of `RecursiveAction`. The `compute()` method is overridden to perform some computation. If the range of numbers to compute is small enough (less than or equal to 10), it computes the numbers directly. Otherwise, it splits the range into two and computes them concurrently using `fork()` and `join()`.

In the `main()` method, an instance of `MyRecursiveAction` is created with a range of 0 to 100, and the `compute()` method is called to start the computation.

```

In this example, we create a `RecursiveTask` that calculates the sum of the first `n` numbers. The `compute()` method is overridden to calculate the sum, and if `n` is less than or equal to 1, it returns `n`. Otherwise, it creates two subtasks (`f1` and `f2`) to calculate the sum of the first `n-1` and `n-2` numbers, respectively. The `f1.fork()` method is used to start the subtask, and the `f1.join()` method is used to wait for the subtask to complete and get its result.

The `getRawResult()` method is used to get the result of the task, even if the task has not yet completed. If the task has not yet completed, `getRawResult()` returns null.

The `setRawResult(V value)` method is a protected method in the `java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask` class. It is used to set the raw result of the task. This method is designed to support extensions, and should not in general be called otherwise.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `setRawResult(V value)` method:

```java

```

In the above code, `MyTask` is a subclass of `RecursiveTask<Integer>`. The `compute()` method is overridden to perform the computation. If the size of the data to be processed is less than or equal to the threshold, the computation is performed directly. Otherwise, the task is divided into two subtasks and the results are combined.

The `setRawResult(Integer value)` method is overridden to set the raw result of the task. This method is called by the `compute()` method when the task is completed.

            semaphore.release();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a `Semaphore` with a permit count of 1. We then call `acquire(1)` on the semaphore. If the semaphore has permits available, it will acquire them and the program will print "Acquired permit". If not, the program will wait until a permit becomes available or the thread is interrupted. After the semaphore is acquired, we call `release()` to release the permit.

Please note that the `acquire(int permits)` method can throw `InterruptedException` if the current thread is interrupted while waiting for a permit. This exception should be caught and handled appropriately in your code.

release
public void release()
Releases a permit, returning it to the semaphore.

 Releases a permit, increasing the number of available permits by
 one.  If any threads are trying to acquire a permit, then one is
 selected and given the permit that was just released.  That thread
 is (re)enabled for thread scheduling purposes.

 There is no requirement that a thread that releases a permit must
 have acquired that permit by calling acquire().

In this code snippet, we first create a `Semaphore` object with a permit count of 1. Then we acquire a permit from the semaphore. After that, we execute a critical section of code. If an exception occurs during the execution of the critical section, we catch the exception and print the stack trace. Finally, we release the permit back to the semaphore.

Please note that the critical section of code is just a placeholder and can be replaced with any code that needs to be executed in a synchronized manner.

release
public void release(int permits)
Releases the given number of permits, returning them to the semaphore.

 Releases the given number of permits, increasing the number of
 available permits by that amount.
 If any threads are trying to acquire permits, then one
 is selected and given the permits that were just released.
 If the number of available permits satisfies that thread's request
 then that thread is (re)enabled for thread scheduling purposes;
 otherwise the thread will wait until sufficient permits are available.
 If there are still permits available
 after this thread's request has been satisfied, then those permits
 are assigned in turn to other threads trying to acquire permits.

 There is no requirement that a thread that releases a permit must
 have acquired that permit by calling acquire.

The `isEmpty()` method in `SynchronousQueue` always returns `true` because it doesn't have any elements. It's a special kind of queue that can only hold one element at a time. When you try to add an element to a full queue, the `put()` method will block until there's a matching `take()` operation. Similarly, when you try to take an element from an empty queue, the `take()` method will block until there's a matching `put()` operation.

Here is a simple code snippet that demonstrates how to use `nextFloat()` method from `java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        float randomFloat = ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextFloat();
        System.out.println("Random float: " + randomFloat);
    }
}
```

In this code, `ThreadLocalRandom.current().nextFloat()` generates a random float number between 0.0 (inclusive) and 1.0 (exclusive). The generated random float number is then printed to the console.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is a simple example of how to use the `rejectedExecution` method from `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThreadPoolExecutor executor = (ThreadPoolExecutor) Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
        executor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy());

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            executor.execute(new Task(i));
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}

class Task implements Runnable {
    private int id;

    public Task(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Task " + id + " is running");
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with a maximum of 2 threads. We then set the `RejectedExecutionHandler` to `DiscardPolicy`, which means that tasks that cannot be executed because the executor is shut down or saturated will be discarded.

We then submit 10 tasks to the executor, which will print "Task 0 is running" to the console. The remaining tasks will be discarded.

Please note that the `DiscardPolicy` does not throw an exception when a task is rejected, it simply discards the task. This can be useful in certain situations, but it's important to understand that this can lead to lost tasks if the executor is shut down before all tasks have been submitted.
