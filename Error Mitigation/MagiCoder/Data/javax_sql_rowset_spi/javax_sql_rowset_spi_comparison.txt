Sample: 0 SyncFactory
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Context
Here is the description of the package The standard classes and interfaces that a third party vendor has touse in its implementation of a synchronization provider.
Here is the description of the class The Service Provider Interface (SPI) mechanism that generates SyncProvider instances to be used by disconnected RowSet objects.

@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.sql.rowset.spi.SyncFactory package from Java
Given the context, recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, 
Do not recommend methods inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
1. `boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.
2. `void clear()`: This method removes all of the elements from this list.
3. `boolean contains(Object o)`: This method returns true if this list contains the specified element.
4. `boolean remove(Object o)`: This method removes the first occurrence of the specified element from this list, if it is present.
5. `int size()`: This method returns the number of elements in this list.
