Sample: 0 SoftReference
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Context
Here is the description of the package: Provides reference-object classes, which support a limited degree ofinteraction with the garbage collector.
Here is the description of the class: Soft reference objects, which are cleared at the discretion of the garbage collector in response to memory demand.
Here is the full description of the method: 


get
public T get()
Returns this reference object's referent.  If this reference object has
 been cleared, either by the program or by the garbage collector, then
 this method returns null.

Overrides:
get in class Reference<T>
Returns:
The object to which this reference refers, or
           null if this reference object has been cleared




@@ Instruction
I want to learn how to use T get() from java.lang.ref.SoftReference
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

@@ Response
Here is a complete code snippet of the `get()` method from `java.lang.ref.SoftReference`:

```java
import java.lang.ref.SoftReference;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "Hello, World!";
        SoftReference<String> softRef = new SoftReference<>(str);

        // Get the object
        String obj = softRef.get();
        if (obj!= null) {
            System.out.println(obj);
        } else {
            System.out.println("The object has been garbage collected.");
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a `SoftReference` object that refers to a `String` object. We then call the `get()` method on the `SoftReference` object, which returns the object if it's still in memory, or `null` if it has been garbage collected.
