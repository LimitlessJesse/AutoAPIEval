Here is the description of the class: This class provides the functionality of a cryptographic cipher for encryption and decryption.
Here is the full description of the method: 


doFinal
public final byte[] doFinal(byte[] input)
                     throws IllegalBlockSizeException,
                            BadPaddingException
Encrypts or decrypts data in a single-part operation, or finishes a
 multiple-part operation. The data is encrypted or decrypted,
 depending on how this cipher was initialized.

 The bytes in the input buffer, and any input bytes that
 may have been buffered during a previous update operation,
 are processed, with padding (if requested) being applied.
 If an AEAD mode such as GCM/CCM is being used, the authentication
 tag is appended in the case of encryption, or verified in the
 case of decryption.
 The result is stored in a new buffer.

 Upon finishing, this method resets this cipher object to the state
 it was in when previously initialized via a call to init.
 That is, the object is reset and available to encrypt or decrypt
 (depending on the operation mode that was specified in the call to
 init) more data.

 Note: if any exception is thrown, this cipher object may need to
 be reset before it can be used again.

Parameters:
input - the input buffer
Returns:
the new buffer with the result
Throws:
IllegalStateException - if this cipher is in a wrong state
 (e.g., has not been initialized)
IllegalBlockSizeException - if this cipher is a block cipher,
 no padding has been requested (only in encryption mode), and the total
 input length of the data processed by this cipher is not a multiple of
 block size; or if this encryption algorithm is unable to
 process the input data provided.
BadPaddingException - if this cipher is in decryption mode,
 and (un)padding has been requested, but the decrypted data is not
 bounded by the appropriate padding bytes
AEADBadTagException - if this cipher is decrypting in an
 AEAD mode (such as GCM/CCM), and the received authentication tag
 does not match the calculated value

This code snippet demonstrates how to use the `doFinal` method. It first generates a secret key using the `KeyGenerator` class. Then, it creates a `Cipher` instance and initializes it for encryption and decryption. After that, it encrypts and decrypts a string of data. The decrypted data is then printed to the console.

init
public final void init(int opmode,
                       Key key)
                throws InvalidKeyException
Initializes this cipher with a key.

 The cipher is initialized for one of the following four operations:
 encryption, decryption, key wrapping or key unwrapping, depending
 on the value of opmode.

 If this cipher requires any algorithm parameters that cannot be
 derived from the given key, the underlying cipher
 implementation is supposed to generate the required parameters itself
 (using provider-specific default or random values) if it is being
 initialized for encryption or key wrapping, and raise an
 InvalidKeyException if it is being
 initialized for decryption or key unwrapping.
 The generated parameters can be retrieved using
 getParameters or
 getIV (if the parameter is an IV).

 If this cipher requires algorithm parameters that cannot be
 derived from the input parameters, and there are no reasonable
 provider-specific default values, initialization will
 necessarily fail.

 If this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme)
 requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation), it will get
 them using the SecureRandom
 implementation of the highest-priority
 installed provider as the source of randomness.
 (If none of the installed providers supply an implementation of
 SecureRandom, a system-provided source of randomness will be used.)

 Note that when a Cipher object is initialized, it loses all
 previously-acquired state. In other words, initializing a Cipher is
 equivalent to creating a new instance of that Cipher and initializing
 it.

Parameters:
opmode - the operation mode of this cipher (this is one of
 the following:
 ENCRYPT_MODE, DECRYPT_MODE,
 WRAP_MODE or UNWRAP_MODE)
key - the key
Throws:
InvalidKeyException - if the given key is inappropriate for
 initializing this cipher, or requires
 algorithm parameters that cannot be
 determined from the given key, or if the given key has a keysize that
 exceeds the maximum allowable keysize (as determined from the
 configured jurisdiction policy files).
UnsupportedOperationException - if (@code opmode} is
 WRAP_MODE or UNWRAP_MODE but the mode is not implemented
 by the underlying CipherSpi.

In this code snippet, we first generate a secret key using `KeyGenerator`. Then, we create a `Cipher` instance and initialize it with the `ENCRYPT_MODE` and the secret key. If the initialization is successful, we print a success message. If any exception occurs during the initialization, we print the stack trace.

Please replace `"AES"` with the actual algorithm you want to use. The algorithm must be supported by the JVM you are using.

Also, please note that the `init` method can throw `InvalidKeyException` if the key is inappropriate for initializing the cipher, or if the key requires algorithm parameters that cannot be determined from the given key, or if the key has a keysize that exceeds the maximum allowable keysize.

Please note that the `read` method in `CipherInputStream` is a blocking method, which means it will not return until some data is available or an error occurs. Therefore, you need to implement your own logic in the `read` method of the `InputStream`.

Also, please replace `"AES"` with the actual cipher algorithm you want to use.

        } catch (Exception e) {

In this code snippet, we first create a `Cipher` object and an `InputStream`. Then we create a `CipherInputStream` using the `Cipher` and `InputStream`. We then create a byte array and call the `read` method on the `CipherInputStream`. The `read` method reads data from the `InputStream` and processes it using the `Cipher`, and the length of the data read is returned.

Please note that this is a simple example and may not work as expected in a real-world scenario. You need to replace the `InputStream` with a real `InputStream` that provides data to be processed by the `Cipher`.

In this code snippet, we are using the `getInstance` method of the `Mac` class to get an instance of the `Mac` class. The `getInstance` method takes a string parameter which is the name of the algorithm to be used. In this case, we are using the "HmacSHA256" algorithm.

If the algorithm is not found or if there is an error in the padding, the `getInstance` method will throw a `NoSuchAlgorithmException` or `NoSuchPaddingException` respectively.

Please replace "HmacSHA256" with the algorithm you want to use. The algorithm names are case sensitive and should be in the format specified in the Java Cryptography Architecture Standard Algorithm Name Documentation.

In this code snippet, we are creating a `SecretKeyFactory` instance for the "AES" algorithm. Then we create a `SecretKey` using the "AES" algorithm and a key value. We then call the `translateKey` method on the `SecretKeyFactory` instance, passing in the `SecretKey` we created. The `translateKey` method will return a new `SecretKey` object that is compatible with the `SecretKeyFactory`.

Please note that the `translateKey` method is not typically used directly in most applications. It is typically used internally by the `SecretKeyFactory` implementation to convert a key from one format to another.
