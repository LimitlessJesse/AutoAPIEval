Sample: 0 RMIConnectorServer
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Context
Here is the description of the package: The RMI connector is a connector for the JMX Remote API that uses RMI to transmit client requests to a remote MBean server.
Here is the description of the class: A JMX API connector server that creates RMI-based connections from remote clients.
Here is the full description of the method: 


start
public void start()
           throws IOException
Activates the connector server, that is starts listening for
 client connections.  Calling this method when the connector
 server is already active has no effect.  Calling this method
 when the connector server has been stopped will generate an
 IOException.
The behavior of this method when called for the first time
 depends on the parameters that were supplied at construction,
 as described below.
First, an object of a subclass of RMIServerImpl is
 required, to export the connector server through RMI:

If an RMIServerImpl was supplied to the
 constructor, it is used.

 Otherwise, if the protocol part of the
 JMXServiceURL supplied to the constructor was
 iiop, an object of type RMIIIOPServerImpl
 is created.

 Otherwise, if the JMXServiceURL
 was null, or its protocol part was rmi, an object
 of type RMIJRMPServerImpl is created.

 Otherwise, the implementation can create an
 implementation-specific RMIServerImpl or it can throw
 MalformedURLException.

 
If the given address includes a JNDI directory URL as
 specified in the package documentation for javax.management.remote.rmi, then this
 RMIConnectorServer will bootstrap by binding the
 RMIServerImpl to the given address.
If the URL path part of the JMXServiceURL was
 empty or a single slash (/), then the RMI object
 will not be bound to a directory.  Instead, a reference to it
 will be encoded in the URL path of the RMIConnectorServer
 address (returned by getAddress()).  The encodings for
 rmi and iiop are described in the
 package documentation for javax.management.remote.rmi.
The behavior when the URL path is neither empty nor a JNDI
 directory URL, or when the protocol is neither rmi
 nor iiop, is implementation defined, and may
 include throwing MalformedURLException when the
 connector server is created or when it is started.

Throws:
IllegalStateException - if the connector server has
 not been attached to an MBean server.
IOException - if the connector server cannot be
 started, or in the case of the iiop protocol, that
 RMI/IIOP is not supported.

I want to learn how to use void start() from javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIConnectorServer
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is a complete code snippet of the `start()` method from `javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIConnectorServer`:

```java
import javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIConnectorServer;
import java.net.MalformedURLException;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);
            RMIConnectorServer rmiConnectorServer = new RMIConnectorServer();
            rmiConnectorServer.start();
        } catch (RemoteException | MalformedURLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a registry on port 1099. Then we create an instance of `RMIConnectorServer` and call the `start()` method on it. If any `RemoteException` or `MalformedURLException` occurs during this process, it will be caught and printed to the console.

Please note that this code snippet is a basic example and may not work as expected in a real-world scenario. You would need to replace the hardcoded values and add error handling according to your specific requirements.

Here is the description of the package: The RMI connector is a connector for the JMX Remote API that uses RMI to transmit client requests to a remote MBean server.
Here is the description of the class: A JMX API connector server that creates RMI-based connections from remote clients.
Here is the full description of the method: 


stop
public void stop()
          throws IOException
Deactivates the connector server, that is, stops listening for
 client connections.  Calling this method will also close all
 client connections that were made by this server.  After this
 method returns, whether normally or with an exception, the
 connector server will not create any new client
 connections.
Once a connector server has been stopped, it cannot be started
 again.
Calling this method when the connector server has already
 been stopped has no effect.  Calling this method when the
 connector server has not yet been started will disable the
 connector server object permanently.
If closing a client connection produces an exception, that
 exception is not thrown from this method.  A JMXConnectionNotification is emitted from this MBean with the
 connection ID of the connection that could not be closed.
Closing a connector server is a potentially slow operation.
 For example, if a client machine with an open connection has
 crashed, the close operation might have to wait for a network
 protocol timeout.  Callers that do not want to block in a close
 operation should do it in a separate thread.
This method calls the method close on the connector server's RMIServerImpl
 object.
If the RMIServerImpl was bound to a JNDI
 directory by the start method, it is unbound
 from the directory by this method.

Throws:
IOException - if the server cannot be closed cleanly,
 or if the RMIServerImpl cannot be unbound from the
 directory.  When this exception is thrown, the server has
 already attempted to close all client connections, if
 appropriate; to call RMIServerImpl.close(); and to
 unbind the RMIServerImpl from its directory, if
 appropriate.  All client connections are closed except possibly
 those that generated exceptions when the server attempted to
 close them.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `stop()` method from `javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIConnectorServer`:

                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new `RMIConnectorServer`, start it, and then stop it in a `finally` block. If an `IOException` occurs during the start or stop process, it is caught and printed to the console.

Please note that the `RMIConnectorServer` is a part of the JMX (Java Management Extensions) API, which is used for managing and monitoring Java applications. The `stop()` method is used to deactivate the connector server, which means it stops listening for client connections.

The `finally` block is used to ensure that the server is stopped even if an exception is thrown during the start process. This is important because if the server cannot be started, it should not be left in an inconsistent state.
