Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");

Here is a complete code snippet of the `newInstance()` method from `javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory`:

```java
import javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory;
import javax.xml.stream.FactoryConfigurationError;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            XMLEventFactory factory = XMLEventFactory.newInstance();
            System.out.println("XMLEventFactory instance created successfully.");
        } catch (FactoryConfigurationError e) {
            System.out.println("Error creating XMLEventFactory instance: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are importing the `XMLEventFactory` class from the `javax.xml.stream` package. We are then calling the `newInstance()` method on the `XMLEventFactory` class. If the method is successful, it will print a message saying that the `XMLEventFactory` instance was created successfully. If an error occurs during the creation of the instance, it will print an error message.

Please replace "/sample.xml" with the actual path to your XML file.

Also, please note that you need to handle the `XMLStreamException` that can be thrown by the `createXMLStreamReader` method. In the above code, we are catching and printing the stack trace of the exception. You might want to handle the exception in a different way depending on your specific needs.

I want to learn how to use XMLStreamWriter createXMLStreamWriter(OutputStream os, String encoding) from javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is a complete code snippet of the `createXMLStreamWriter` method:

```java
import javax.xml.stream.XMLOutputFactory;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamWriter;
import java.io.OutputStream;
import java.io.FileOutputStream;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            XMLOutputFactory outputFactory = XMLOutputFactory.newInstance();
            OutputStream os = new FileOutputStream("output.xml");
            XMLStreamWriter writer = outputFactory.createXMLStreamWriter(os, "UTF-8");

            // Write XML document
            writer.writeStartDocument("UTF-8", "1.0");
            writer.writeStartElement("root");
            writer.writeCharacters("Hello, World!");
            writer.writeEndElement();
            writer.writeEndDocument();

            // Flush and close
            writer.flush();
            writer.close();
        } catch (XMLStreamException | java.io.IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

This code creates a new XMLStreamWriter that writes to a file named "output.xml". It then writes a simple XML document with a root element containing the text "Hello, World!". The `writeStartDocument`, `writeStartElement`, `writeCharacters`, `writeEndElement`, and `writeEndDocument` methods are used to structure the XML document. Finally, the `flush` and `close` methods are used to ensure that all data is written to the file and that the writer is properly closed.
