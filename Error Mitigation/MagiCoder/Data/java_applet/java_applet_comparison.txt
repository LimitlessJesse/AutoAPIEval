@@ Context
Here is the description of the package Provides the classes necessary to create an applet and the classes an appletuses to communicate with its applet context.
Here is the description of the class An applet is a small program that is intended not to be run on its own, but rather to be embedded inside another application.

@@ Instruction
I want to use java.applet.Applet package from Java
Given the context, recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, 
Do not recommend methods inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
1. `void init()`: This method is called when the applet is first started.
2. `void start()`: This method is called when the applet is started.
3. `void stop()`: This method is called when the applet is stopped.
4. `void destroy()`: This method is called when the applet is destroyed.
5. `void paint(Graphics g)`: This method is called when the applet needs to be painted.

Note: The methods `init()`, `start()`, `stop()`, and `destroy()` are called automatically by the Java Plugin. The method `paint(Graphics g)` is called automatically when the applet needs to be painted.
