In this code snippet, we create an instance of `_PolicyStub` and call the `destroy()` method on it. This is a simple example and does not cover any specific use case. The `destroy()` method is a part of the CORBA API and is used to destroy a policy object. The actual implementation of the `destroy()` method is not provided in the `_PolicyStub` class, but it is expected to be implemented in the actual policy object class.
