Sample: 0 AddressingFeature
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Context
Here is the description of the package: This package defines APIs specific to the SOAP binding.
Here is the description of the class: AddressingFeature represents the use of WS-Addressing with either the SOAP 1.1/HTTP or SOAP 1.2/HTTP binding.
Here is the full description of the method: 


getID
public String getID()
Get the unique identifier for this WebServiceFeature.

Specified by:
getID in class WebServiceFeature
Returns:
the unique identifier for this feature.




@@ Instruction
I want to learn how to use String getID() from javax.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

@@ Response
Here is a complete code snippet of the `getID()` method from the `javax.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature` class:

```java
import javax.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AddressingFeature addressingFeature = new AddressingFeature();
        String id = addressingFeature.getID();
        System.out.println("ID: " + id);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create an instance of `AddressingFeature` and call the `getID()` method. The `getID()` method returns a unique identifier for this feature, which we then print to the console.

Please note that the `getID()` method is a default method in the `WebServiceFeature` interface, which `AddressingFeature` implements. The `getID()` method is not a part of the `AddressingFeature` class, but it is a part of the `WebServiceFeature` interface.
