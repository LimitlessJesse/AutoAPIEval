Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

Here is a complete code snippet of the `first()` method from `java.text.BreakIterator`:

```java
import java.text.BreakIterator;
import java.util.Locale;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Hello, world!";
        BreakIterator iterator = BreakIterator.getWordInstance(Locale.US);
        iterator.setText(text);
        int firstBoundary = iterator.first();
        System.out.println("First boundary: " + firstBoundary);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `BreakIterator` instance for words using the `getWordInstance()` method. We then set the text to be iterated over using the `setText()` method. Finally, we call the `first()` method to get the index of the first boundary in the text.

Please note that the `Locale.US` is used to specify the language and locale for the BreakIterator. You can replace it with any other locale if needed.

Here is the full description of the method: 


following
public abstract int following(int offset)
Returns the first boundary following the specified character offset. If the
 specified offset equals to the last text boundary, it returns
 BreakIterator.DONE and the iterator's current position is unchanged.
 Otherwise, the iterator's current position is set to the returned boundary.
 The value returned is always greater than the offset or the value
 BreakIterator.DONE.

Parameters:
offset - the character offset to begin scanning.
Returns:
The first boundary after the specified offset or
 BreakIterator.DONE if the last text boundary is passed in
 as the offset.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the specified offset is less than
 the first text boundary or greater than the last text boundary.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `following` method from `java.text.BreakIterator`:

    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are using `BreakIterator.getWordInstance(Locale.US)` to get a word boundary iterator for the US locale. We then set the text to be iterated over.

We then use a loop to iterate over the text, printing each word. The `first()` method is used to get the first boundary, and `next()` is used to get the next boundary. The loop continues until `next()` returns `BreakIterator.DONE`, which indicates that we have reached the end of the text.

The `substring(start, end)` method is used to extract the word from the text, where `start` and `end` are the start and end indices of the word in the text.

next
public abstract int next(int n)
Returns the nth boundary from the current boundary. If either
 the first or last text boundary has been reached, it returns
 BreakIterator.DONE and the current position is set to either
 the first or last text boundary depending on which one is reached. Otherwise,
 the iterator's current position is set to the new boundary.
 For example, if the iterator's current position is the mth text boundary
 and three more boundaries exist from the current boundary to the last text
 boundary, the next(2) call will return m + 2. The new text position is set
 to the (m + 2)th text boundary. A next(4) call would return
 BreakIterator.DONE and the last text boundary would become the
 new text position.

Parameters:
n - which boundary to return.  A value of 0
 does nothing.  Negative values move to previous boundaries
 and positive values move to later boundaries.
Returns:

In this code snippet, we first get an instance of the `Collator` class. Then we create a string `text`. We get a `CollationElementIterator` for the `text` using the `getCollationElementIterator` method of the `Collator` class.

If there is a next collation element, we get the offset of the next collation element using the `getOffset` method of the `CollationElementIterator` class.

Please note that the `getOffset` method returns the position in the text corresponding to the collation element that will be returned by the next call to `next()`. This means if you do `setOffset(x)` followed immediately by `getOffset()`, `getOffset()` won't necessarily return `x`.

In this code snippet, we first get an instance of the `Collator` class. Then we create a string `text`. We get a `CollationElementIterator` for the string using the `getCollationElementIterator` method of the `Collator` class. We then set the offset of the iterator to 2 using the `setOffset` method of the `CollationElementIterator` class. Finally, we print the next collation element using the `next` method of the `CollationElementIterator` class.

Please note that the `setOffset` method is not guaranteed to return the same value as was passed to a preceding call to `setOffset`. This is because the offset can be set to the middle of a contracting character sequence, which would result in the next call to `next` returning the collation element for that sequence.

In this code, we first get an instance of the `Collator` class for the English language in the United States. Then we call the `hashCode()` method on this instance and print the result.

The `hashCode()` method returns a hash code value for the object. This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by `java.util.HashMap`. The general contract of `hashCode` is:

- Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the `hashCode` method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in `equals` comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application.
- If two objects are equal according to the `equals(Object)` method, then calling the `hashCode` method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result.
- It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the `equals(java.lang.Object)` method, then calling the `hashCode` method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.

@@ Context
Here is the description of the package: Provides classes and interfaces for handling text, dates, numbers, and messagesin a manner independent of natural languages.

Here is the full description of the method: 


parse
public Number parse(String text,
                    ParsePosition pos)
Parses text from a string to produce a Number.
 
 The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by
 pos.
 If parsing succeeds, then the index of pos is updated
 to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
 use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
 number is returned. The updated pos can be used to
 indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
 If an error occurs, then the index of pos is not
 changed, the error index of pos is set to the index of
 the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.
 
 The subclass returned depends on the value of isParseBigDecimal()
 as well as on the string being parsed.
 
If isParseBigDecimal() is false (the default),
       most integer values are returned as Long
       objects, no matter how they are written: "17" and
       "17.000" both parse to Long(17).
       Values that cannot fit into a Long are returned as
       Doubles. This includes values with a fractional part,
       infinite values, NaN, and the value -0.0.
       DecimalFormat does not decide whether to
       return a Double or a Long based on the
       presence of a decimal separator in the source string. Doing so
       would prevent integers that overflow the mantissa of a double,
       such as "-9,223,372,036,854,775,808.00", from being
       parsed accurately.
       
       Callers may use the Number methods
       doubleValue, longValue, etc., to obtain
       the type they want.
   If isParseBigDecimal() is true, values are returned
       as BigDecimal objects. The values are the ones
       constructed by BigDecimal.BigDecimal(String)
       for corresponding strings in locale-independent format. The
       special cases negative and positive infinity and NaN are returned
       as Double instances holding the values of the
       corresponding Double constants.
 

DecimalFormat parses all Unicode characters that represent
 decimal digits, as defined by Character.digit(). In
 addition, DecimalFormat also recognizes as digits the ten
 consecutive characters starting with the localized zero digit defined in
 the DecimalFormatSymbols object.

Specified by:
parse in class NumberFormat
Parameters:
text - the string to be parsed
pos - A ParsePosition object with index and error
             index information as described above.

the parsed value, or null if the parse fails

Here is a complete code snippet of the method `getPatternSeparator()` from the `java.text.DecimalFormatSymbols` class:

```java
import java.text.DecimalFormatSymbols;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DecimalFormatSymbols symbols = new DecimalFormatSymbols();
        char patternSeparator = symbols.getPatternSeparator();
        System.out.println("Pattern Separator: " + patternSeparator);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first import the `DecimalFormatSymbols` class. Then, we create an instance of `DecimalFormatSymbols` and call the `getPatternSeparator()` method. The result is stored in the `patternSeparator` variable, which is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `getPatternSeparator()` method returns the default pattern separator for the current locale. If you want to get the pattern separator for a specific locale, you can use the `DecimalFormatSymbols(Locale locale)` constructor to create a `DecimalFormatSymbols` instance with the desired locale.

Here is a simple example of how to use the `format` method from the `java.text.Format` class:

```java
import java.text.Format;
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Format formatter = new SimpleDateFormat("dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss");
        Date date = new Date();
        String formattedDate = formatter.format(date);
        System.out.println(formattedDate);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `Format` object that formats dates in the "dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss" format. We then create a `Date` object representing the current date and time, and use the `format` method to convert this date into a string. The formatted date is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `format` method can throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the given object cannot be formatted. In a real-world application, you would need to handle this exception appropriately.

Formats an object and appends the resulting text to a given string
 buffer.
 If the pos argument identifies a field used by the format,
 then its indices are set to the beginning and end of the first such
 field encountered.

Parameters:
obj - The object to format
toAppendTo - where the text is to be appended
pos - A FieldPosition identifying a field
               in the formatted text
Returns:
the string buffer passed in as toAppendTo,

In this code, we create a new `Format` object that overrides the `format` method. This method simply appends the object to the `StringBuffer` and returns it.

In the `main` method, we create a new `StringBuffer` and a `FieldPosition`, and then use the `format` method to append the string "Hello, World!" to the `StringBuffer`. Finally, we print the `StringBuffer` to the console.

 collation rules.  Returns information about whether a string is less
 than, greater than or equal to another string in a language.
 This can be overriden in a subclass.

Specified by:
compare in class Collator
Parameters:
source - the source string.
target - the target string.
Returns:
Returns an integer value. Value is less than zero if source is less than
 target, value is zero if source and target are equal, value is greater than zero
 if source is greater than target.
Throws:
NullPointerException - if source or target is null.

I want to learn how to use int compare(String source, String target) from java.text.RuleBasedCollator
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `compare` method from `java.text.RuleBasedCollator`:

```java
import java.text.RuleBasedCollator;
import java.util.Locale;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RuleBasedCollator collator = (RuleBasedCollator) Collator.getInstance(new Locale("en", "US"));
        String source = "Hello";
        String target = "World";
        int result = collator.compare(source, target);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are creating a `RuleBasedCollator` object and comparing two strings. The `compare` method returns an integer value indicating whether the source string is less than, equal to, or greater than the target string.

Please note that the `Collator.getInstance(new Locale("en", "US"))` is used to get the `RuleBasedCollator` instance. You can replace `"en", "US"` with the locale you want to use.

Also, please note that the `compare` method is case sensitive. If you want to ignore case, you can use the `compare(String, String, boolean)` method which takes a boolean parameter to ignore case.

Here is a complete code snippet of this method:

```java
import java.text.StringCharacterIterator;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringCharacterIterator iterator = new StringCharacterIterator("Hello");
        int hashCode = iterator.hashCode();
        System.out.println("Hashcode: " + hashCode);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a `StringCharacterIterator` object with the string "Hello". Then we call the `hashCode()` method on the iterator and print the result.

The `hashCode()` method in `java.text.StringCharacterIterator` is overridden from `java.lang.Object` and returns a hash code for this iterator. The hash code is computed as the sum of the hash codes of the characters in the string.
