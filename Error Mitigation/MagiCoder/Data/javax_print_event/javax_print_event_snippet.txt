printDataTransferCompleted
public void printDataTransferCompleted(PrintJobEvent pje)
Called to notify the client that data has been successfully
 transferred to the print service, and the client may free
 local resources allocated for that data.  The client should
 not assume that the data has been completely printed after
 receiving this event.

pje - the event being notified

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");

Here is a complete code snippet of the `printDataTransferCompleted` method from `javax.print.event.PrintJobAdapter`:

```java
import javax.print.event.PrintJobAdapter;
import javax.print.event.PrintJobEvent;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PrintJobAdapter adapter = new PrintJobAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void printDataTransferCompleted(PrintJobEvent pje) {
                // Your code here
            }
        };

        // You can use the adapter here
    }
}
```

In the code snippet above, we create a new `PrintJobAdapter` and override the `printDataTransferCompleted` method. Inside this method, you can put the code that you want to execute when the event is triggered.

Please note that you need to replace `// Your code here` with your actual code. This is just a placeholder.
