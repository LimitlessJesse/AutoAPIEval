Here is the description of the package: Provides the definition of the Timer MBean.
Here is the description of the class: Provides the implementation of the timer MBean.
Here is the full description of the method: 


start
public void start()
Starts the timer.
 
 If there is one or more timer notifications before the time in the list of notifications, the notification
 is sent according to the sendPastNotifications flag and then, updated
 according to its period and remaining number of occurrences.
 If the timer notification date remains earlier than the current date, this notification is just removed
 from the list of notifications.

Specified by:
start in interface TimerMBean

I want to learn how to use void start() from javax.management.timer.Timer
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is a complete code snippet of the `start()` method from the `javax.management.timer.Timer` package:

```java
import javax.management.timer.TimerMBean;
import javax.management.timer.Timer;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TimerMBean timer = new Timer();
        timer.start();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are creating an instance of the `Timer` class which implements the `TimerMBean` interface. Then we call the `start()` method on this instance.

Please note that the `start()` method does not have any parameters and does not return any value. It is a void method.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `stop()` method from `javax.management.timer.Timer`:

```java
import javax.management.timer.TimerMBean;
import javax.management.timer.Timer;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TimerMBean timer = new Timer();
        timer.stop();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new instance of `Timer` and call the `stop()` method on it. The `stop()` method is a part of the `TimerMBean` interface, so it is available to us.

Please note that the `Timer` class is not part of the standard Java API, it's a part of the `javax.management.timer` package. You need to add the `jmxri.jar` and `jmxtools.jar` to your classpath to use this package.
