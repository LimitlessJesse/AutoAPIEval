Here is a complete code snippet of the `booleanValue()` method from the `java.lang.Boolean` class:

```java
import java.lang.Boolean;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Boolean bool = new Boolean(true);
        boolean boolValue = bool.booleanValue();

In this code, we create three Boolean objects `b1`, `b2`, and `b3`. The first two are initialized to `Boolean.TRUE`, which is a constant representing the boolean value `true`. The third one is initialized to `Boolean.FALSE`, which is a constant representing the boolean value `false`.

We then call the `equals(Object obj)` method on `b1` and `b2`, and `b1` and `b3`. The `equals(Object obj)` method returns `true` if the argument is not null and is a Boolean object that represents the same boolean value as this object, and `false` otherwise.

So, in the output, we see that `b1.equals(b2)` returns `true` because `b1` and `b2` represent the same boolean value (`true`), and `b1.equals(b3)` returns `false` because `b1` and `b3` represent different boolean values (`true` and `false`, respectively).

We then call the `isDigit` method on `ch` and store the result in the `isDigit` variable. Finally, we print out whether `ch` is a digit or not.

isLetter
public static boolean isLetter(char ch)
Determines if the specified character is a letter.
 
 A character is considered to be a letter if its general
 category type, provided by Character.getType(ch),
 is any of the following:
 
 UPPERCASE_LETTER
 LOWERCASE_LETTER
 TITLECASE_LETTER
 MODIFIER_LETTER
 OTHER_LETTER


 Not all letters have case. Many characters are
 letters but are neither uppercase nor lowercase nor titlecase.

 Note: This method cannot handle  supplementary characters. To support
 all Unicode characters, including supplementary characters, use
 the isLetter(int) method.

Parameters:
ch - the character to be tested.
Returns:
true if the character is a letter;
          false otherwise.

getInterfaces
public Class<?>[] getInterfaces()
Determines the interfaces implemented by the class or interface
 represented by this object.

  If this object represents a class, the return value is an array
 containing objects representing all interfaces implemented by the
 class. The order of the interface objects in the array corresponds to
 the order of the interface names in the implements clause
 of the declaration of the class represented by this object. For
 example, given the declaration:
 
class Shimmer implements FloorWax, DessertTopping { ... }

 suppose the value of s is an instance of
 Shimmer; the value of the expression:
 
s.getClass().getInterfaces()[0]

 is the Class object that represents interface
 FloorWax; and the value of:
 
s.getClass().getInterfaces()[1]

 is the Class object that represents interface
 DessertTopping.

  If this object represents an interface, the array contains objects
 representing all interfaces extended by the interface. The order of the
 interface objects in the array corresponds to the order of the interface
 names in the extends clause of the declaration of the
 interface represented by this object.

  If this object represents a class or interface that implements no
 interfaces, the method returns an array of length 0.

  If this object represents a primitive type or void, the method
 returns an array of length 0.

  If this Class object represents an array type, the
 interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable are
 returned in that order.

Returns:

Please note that the `getFields()` method only returns public fields. If you want to get all fields (public, protected, package-private, and private), you should use the `getDeclaredFields()` method instead.

getParent
public final ClassLoader getParent()
Returns the parent class loader for delegation. Some implementations may
 use null to represent the bootstrap class loader. This method
 will return null in such implementations if this class loader's
 parent is the bootstrap class loader.

  If a security manager is present, and the invoker's class loader is
 not null and is not an ancestor of this class loader, then this
 method invokes the security manager's checkPermission method with a RuntimePermission("getClassLoader") permission to verify
 access to the parent class loader is permitted.  If not, a
 SecurityException will be thrown.  

Returns:
The parent ClassLoader
Throws:
SecurityException - If a security manager exists and its checkPermission
          method doesn't allow access to this class loader's parent class
          loader.

Here is the description of the class: A class loader is an object that is responsible for loading classes.
Here is the full description of the method: 


getSystemClassLoader
public static ClassLoader getSystemClassLoader()
Returns the system class loader for delegation.  This is the default
 delegation parent for new ClassLoader instances, and is
 typically the class loader used to start the application.

  This method is first invoked early in the runtime's startup
 sequence, at which point it creates the system class loader and sets it
 as the context class loader of the invoking Thread.

  The default system class loader is an implementation-dependent
 instance of this class.

  If the system property "java.system.class.loader" is defined
 when this method is first invoked then the value of that property is
 taken to be the name of a class that will be returned as the system
 class loader.  The class is loaded using the default system class loader
 and must define a public constructor that takes a single parameter of
 type ClassLoader which is used as the delegation parent.  An
 instance is then created using this constructor with the default system
 class loader as the parameter.  The resulting class loader is defined
 to be the system class loader.

  If a security manager is present, and the invoker's class loader is
 not null and the invoker's class loader is not the same as or
 an ancestor of the system class loader, then this method invokes the
 security manager's checkPermission method with a RuntimePermission("getClassLoader") permission to verify
 access to the system class loader.  If not, a
 SecurityException will be thrown.  

Returns:
The system ClassLoader for delegation, or
          null if none
Throws:
SecurityException - If a security manager exists and its checkPermission
          method doesn't allow access to the system class loader.
IllegalStateException - If invoked recursively during the construction of the class
          loader specified by the "java.system.class.loader"
          property.
Error - If the system property "java.system.class.loader"
          is defined but the named class could not be loaded, the
          provider class does not define the required constructor, or an
          exception is thrown by that constructor when it is invoked. The
          underlying cause of the error can be retrieved via the

Also, the `loadClass` method is used in a context where we are using reflection to get the `length` method of the `String` class and invoke it on a new instance of the `String` class. This is just an example of how you can use the `loadClass` method. You can replace the class and method names with your own.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `compareTo` method from the `java.lang.Enum` class:

```java
import java.lang.Enum;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Assume we have an enum named 'MyEnum' with constants 'A', 'B', and 'C'
        MyEnum myEnum1 = MyEnum.A;
        MyEnum myEnum2 = MyEnum.B;

        // Compare'myEnum1' with'myEnum2'
        int result = myEnum1.compareTo(myEnum2);

        // Print the result
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}

enum MyEnum {
    A, B, C;
}
```

In this code, we are comparing two enum constants `myEnum1` and `myEnum2`. The `compareTo` method returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer if `myEnum1` is less than, equal to, or greater than `myEnum2`, respectively.

Please replace `MyEnum` with your actual enum class name.

The `equals(Object other)` method in `java.lang.Enum` is used to compare the equality of two enum constants. It is final and is inherited from the `java.lang.Object` class.

Here is a complete code snippet of this method:

```java
import java.lang.Enum;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define an enum
        enum Color {
            RED, GREEN, BLUE;

        // Get the enum constants
        Color color1 = Color.RED;
        Color color2 = Color.GREEN;
        Color color3 = Color.BLUE;

        // Compare the enum constants
        System.out.println(color1.equals(color2));  // Output: false
        System.out.println(color1.equals(color3));  // Output: false
        System.out.println(color2.equals(color3));  // Output: false
    }
}
```

In this code, we define an enum `Color` with three constants: `RED`, `GREEN`, and `BLUE`. We then compare each constant with every other constant using the `equals()` method. The output of this program will be `false` for all comparisons, because by default, the `equals()` method in `java.lang.Enum` compares the memory addresses of the enum constants, not their values.

Here is the description of the class: The Float class wraps a value of primitive type float in an object.
Here is the full description of the method: 


intBitsToFloat
public static float intBitsToFloat(int bits)
Returns the float value corresponding to a given
 bit representation.
 The argument is considered to be a representation of a
 floating-point value according to the IEEE 754 floating-point
 "single format" bit layout.

 If the argument is 0x7f800000, the result is positive
 infinity.

 If the argument is 0xff800000, the result is negative
 infinity.

 If the argument is any value in the range
 0x7f800001 through 0x7fffffff or in
 the range 0xff800001 through
 0xffffffff, the result is a NaN.  No IEEE 754
 floating-point operation provided by Java can distinguish
 between two NaN values of the same type with different bit
 patterns.  Distinct values of NaN are only distinguishable by
 use of the Float.floatToRawIntBits method.

 In all other cases, let s, e, and m be three
 values that can be computed from the argument:

 
 int s = ((bits >> 31) == 0) ? 1 : -1;
 int e = ((bits >> 23) & 0xff);
 int m = (e == 0) ?
                 (bits & 0x7fffff) << 1 :
                 (bits & 0x7fffff) | 0x800000;
 

 Then the floating-point result equals the value of the mathematical
 expression s·m·2e-150.

 Note that this method may not be able to return a
 float NaN with exactly same bit pattern as the
 int argument.  IEEE 754 distinguishes between two
 kinds of NaNs, quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs.  The
 differences between the two kinds of NaN are generally not
 visible in Java.  Arithmetic operations on signaling NaNs turn
 them into quiet NaNs with a different, but often similar, bit
 pattern.  However, on some processors merely copying a
 signaling NaN also performs that conversion.  In particular,
 copying a signaling NaN to return it to the calling method may
 perform this conversion.  So intBitsToFloat may
 not be able to return a float with a signaling NaN
 bit pattern.  Consequently, for some int values,
 floatToRawIntBits(intBitsToFloat(start)) may
 not equal start.  Moreover, which
 particular bit patterns represent signaling NaNs is platform
 dependent; although all NaN bit patterns, quiet or signaling,
 must be in the NaN range identified above.

Parameters:
bits - an integer.
Returns:
the float floating-point value with the same bit
          pattern.

                    throws NumberFormatException
Parses the string argument as a signed integer in the radix
 specified by the second argument. The characters in the string
 must all be digits of the specified radix (as determined by
 whether Character.digit(char, int) returns a
 nonnegative value), except that the first character may be an
 ASCII minus sign '-' ('\u002D') to
 indicate a negative value or an ASCII plus sign '+'
 ('\u002B') to indicate a positive value. The
 resulting integer value is returned.

 An exception of type NumberFormatException is
 thrown if any of the following situations occurs:
 
The first argument is null or is a string of
 length zero.

 The radix is either smaller than
 Character.MIN_RADIX or
 larger than Character.MAX_RADIX.

 Any character of the string is not a digit of the specified
 radix, except that the first character may be a minus sign
 '-' ('\u002D') or plus sign
 '+' ('\u002B') provided that the
 string is longer than length 1.

 The value represented by the string is not a value of type
 int.
 
Examples:
 
 parseInt("0", 10) returns 0
 parseInt("473", 10) returns 473
 parseInt("+42", 10) returns 42

parseLong
public static long parseLong(String s,
                             int radix)
                      throws NumberFormatException
Parses the string argument as a signed long in the
 radix specified by the second argument. The characters in the
 string must all be digits of the specified radix (as determined
 by whether Character.digit(char, int) returns
 a nonnegative value), except that the first character may be an
 ASCII minus sign '-' ('\u002D') to
 indicate a negative value or an ASCII plus sign '+'
 ('\u002B') to indicate a positive value. The
 resulting long value is returned.

 Note that neither the character L
 ('\u004C') nor l
 ('\u006C') is permitted to appear at the end
 of the string as a type indicator, as would be permitted in
 Java programming language source code - except that either
 L or l may appear as a digit for a
 radix greater than or equal to 22.

 An exception of type NumberFormatException is
 thrown if any of the following situations occurs:
 
The first argument is null or is a string of
 length zero.

 The radix is either smaller than Character.MIN_RADIX or larger than Character.MAX_RADIX.

 Any character of the string is not a digit of the specified
 radix, except that the first character may be a minus sign
 '-' ('\u002d') or plus sign '+' ('\u002B') provided that the string is
 longer than length 1.

 The value represented by the string is not a value of type
      long.
 
Examples:
 
 parseLong("0", 10) returns 0L
 parseLong("473", 10) returns 473L
 parseLong("+42", 10) returns 42L
 parseLong("-0", 10) returns 0L
 parseLong("-FF", 16) returns -255L
 parseLong("1100110", 2) returns 102L
 parseLong("99", 8) throws a NumberFormatException
 parseLong("Hazelnut", 10) throws a NumberFormatException
 parseLong("Hazelnut", 36) returns 1356099454469L
 

Parameters:
s - the String containing the
                     long representation to be parsed.
radix - the radix to be used while parsing s.
Returns:
the long represented by the string argument in
             the specified radix.
Throws:
NumberFormatException - if the string does not contain a
             parsable long.

 If the first argument is finite and less than zero
 
 if the second argument is a finite even integer, the
 result is equal to the result of raising the absolute value of
 the first argument to the power of the second argument

 if the second argument is a finite odd integer, the result
 is equal to the negative of the result of raising the absolute
 value of the first argument to the power of the second
 argument

 if the second argument is finite and not an integer, then
 the result is NaN.
 
If both arguments are integers, then the result is exactly equal
 to the mathematical result of raising the first argument to the power
 of the second argument if that result can in fact be represented
 exactly as a double value.
(In the foregoing descriptions, a floating-point value is
 considered to be an integer if and only if it is finite and a
 fixed point of the method ceil or,
 equivalently, a fixed point of the method floor. A value is a fixed point of a one-argument
 method if and only if the result of applying the method to the
 value is equal to the value.)

 The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result.
 Results must be semi-monotonic.

Parameters:
a - the base.
b - the exponent.
Returns:
the value ab.

random
public static double random()
Returns a double value with a positive sign, greater
 than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.
 Returned values are chosen pseudorandomly with (approximately)
 uniform distribution from that range.

 When this method is first called, it creates a single new
 pseudorandom-number generator, exactly as if by the expression

 new java.util.Random()

 This new pseudorandom-number generator is used thereafter for
 all calls to this method and is used nowhere else.

 This method is properly synchronized to allow correct use by
 more than one thread. However, if many threads need to generate
 pseudorandom numbers at a great rate, it may reduce contention
 for each thread to have its own pseudorandom-number generator.

Returns:
a pseudorandom double greater than or equal
 to 0.0 and less than 1.0.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `log10` method from the `java.lang.Math` class:

```java
import java.lang.Math;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double a = 100;
        double result = Math.log10(a);
        System.out.println("The base 10 logarithm of " + a + " is " + result);
    }

IEEEremainder
public static double IEEEremainder(double f1,
                                   double f2)
Computes the remainder operation on two arguments as prescribed
 by the IEEE 754 standard.
 The remainder value is mathematically equal to
 f1 - f2 × n,
 where n is the mathematical integer closest to the exact
 mathematical value of the quotient f1/f2, and if two
 mathematical integers are equally close to f1/f2,
 then n is the integer that is even. If the remainder is
 zero, its sign is the same as the sign of the first argument.
 Special cases:
 If either argument is NaN, or the first argument is infinite,
 or the second argument is positive zero or negative zero, then the
 result is NaN.
 If the first argument is finite and the second argument is
 infinite, then the result is the same as the first argument.

Parameters:
f1 - the dividend.
f2 - the divisor.
Returns:
the remainder when f1 is divided by
          f2.

Here is the full description of the method: 


equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.
 
 The equals method implements an equivalence relation
 on non-null object references:
 
It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value
     x, x.equals(x) should return
     true.
 It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values
     x and y, x.equals(y)
     should return true if and only if
     y.equals(x) returns true.
 It is transitive: for any non-null reference values
     x, y, and z, if
     x.equals(y) returns true and
     y.equals(z) returns true, then
     x.equals(z) should return true.
 It is consistent: for any non-null reference values
     x and y, multiple invocations of
     x.equals(y) consistently return true
     or consistently return false, provided no
     information used in equals comparisons on the
     objects is modified.
 For any non-null reference value x,
     x.equals(null) should return false.
 

 The equals method for class Object implements
 the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
 that is, for any non-null reference values x and
 y, this method returns true if and only
 if x and y refer to the same object
 (x == y has the value true).
 
 Note that it is generally necessary to override the hashCode
 method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
 general contract for the hashCode method, which states
 that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

Parameters:
obj - the reference object with which to compare.
Returns:
true if this object is the same as the obj
          argument; false otherwise.

```java
import java.lang.Object;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj1 = new Object();
        Object obj2 = new Object();
        Object obj3 = obj1;

        // Testing reflexivity
        System.out.println("Reflexivity: " + obj1.equals(obj1)); // Expected: true

        // Testing symmetry
        System.out.println("Symmetry: " + (obj1.equals(obj2) == obj2.equals(obj1))); // Expected: true

        // Testing transitivity
        System.out.println("Transitivity: " + (obj1.equals(obj2) && obj2.equals(obj3) == obj1.equals(obj3))); // Expected: true

        // Testing consistency
        System.out.println("Consistency: " + (obj1.equals(obj2) == obj1.equals(obj2))); // Expected: true

        // Testing null
        System.out.println("Null: " + (obj1.equals(null))); // Expected: false
    }
}
```

In this code, we create three objects `obj1`, `obj2`, and `obj3`. We then test the `equals(Object obj)` method for each of these objects against each other and against itself. The expected results are printed at the end of each test.

Here is the description of the class: Class Object is the root of the class hierarchy.
Here is the full description of the method: 


toString
public String toString()
Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the
 toString method returns a string that
 "textually represents" this object. The result should
 be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a
 person to read.
 It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.
 
 The toString method for class Object
 returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the
 object is an instance, the at-sign character `@', and
 the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the
 object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the
 value of:
 

 getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())
 

Returns:
a string representation of the object.

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

In this code, we create a new Object and then call the toString() method on it. The toString() method is inherited from the Object class, so we don't need to override it. The output will be the class name and the hash code of the object, in the format "classname@hashcode".

In this code snippet, we are creating a `ProcessBuilder` for the `ls -l` command. We then redirect the standard error output to a file named `error.txt`. After that, we start the process and wait for it to finish. If the process exits with an error code, we print that error code.

Please note that this code snippet is just an example and may not work on your system. You need to replace `"ls -l"` with the actual command you want to run. Also, you need to have the necessary permissions to run the command and write to the file.

If the process finishes successfully, the exit code will be printed to the console. If an error occurs, it will be printed to the console.

Please note that the `command` method is used to set the command and its arguments for the process that will be started by the `start` method. The `start` method actually starts the process and returns a `Process` object that can be used to interact with the process.

In this code snippet, we are using the `exec` method of the `Runtime` class to execute the command `"ls -l"`. The `exec` method returns a `Process` object, which we then print the process ID of.

Please note that the `pid()` method is not available in all versions of Java. If you are using Java 9 or later, you should use `ProcessHandle.current().pid()` instead.

Also, the `exec` method can throw an `IOException` if an I/O error occurs. We handle this exception by catching it in a `try-catch` block.

In this code snippet, we are using `Runtime.getRuntime().exec(command)` to execute a command. The command is an array of strings where the first element is the path to the executable and the rest are the arguments.

The `waitFor()` method is used to wait for the process to complete and return the exit code. If the process does not complete within a specified time, the `waitFor(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` method can be used to wait for a specified amount of time.

The `IOException` and `InterruptedException` are checked exceptions that may be thrown by the `exec` method and the `waitFor` method. We need to handle these exceptions using a try-catch block.

Here is the full description of the method: 


addShutdownHook
public void addShutdownHook(Thread hook)
Registers a new virtual-machine shutdown hook.

  The Java virtual machine shuts down in response to two kinds
 of events:

   
 The program exits normally, when the last non-daemon
   thread exits or when the exit (equivalently,
   System.exit) method is invoked, or

    The virtual machine is terminated in response to a
   user interrupt, such as typing ^C, or a system-wide event,
   such as user logoff or system shutdown.

   
 A shutdown hook is simply an initialized but unstarted
 thread.  When the virtual machine begins its shutdown sequence it will
 start all registered shutdown hooks in some unspecified order and let
 them run concurrently.  When all the hooks have finished it will then
 halt. Note that daemon threads will continue to run during the shutdown
 sequence, as will non-daemon threads if shutdown was initiated by
 invoking the exit method.

  Once the shutdown sequence has begun it can be stopped only by
 invoking the halt method, which forcibly
 terminates the virtual machine.

  Once the shutdown sequence has begun it is impossible to register a
 new shutdown hook or de-register a previously-registered hook.
 Attempting either of these operations will cause an
 IllegalStateException to be thrown.

  Shutdown hooks run at a delicate time in the life cycle of a virtual
 machine and should therefore be coded defensively.  They should, in
 particular, be written to be thread-safe and to avoid deadlocks insofar
 as possible.  They should also not rely blindly upon services that may
 have registered their own shutdown hooks and therefore may themselves in
 the process of shutting down.  Attempts to use other thread-based
 services such as the AWT event-dispatch thread, for example, may lead to
 deadlocks.

  Shutdown hooks should also finish their work quickly.  When a
 program invokes exit the expectation is
 that the virtual machine will promptly shut down and exit.  When the
 virtual machine is terminated due to user logoff or system shutdown the
 underlying operating system may only allow a fixed amount of time in
 which to shut down and exit.  It is therefore inadvisable to attempt any
 user interaction or to perform a long-running computation in a shutdown
 hook.

  Uncaught exceptions are handled in shutdown hooks just as in any
 other thread, by invoking the
 uncaughtException method of the
 thread's ThreadGroup object. The default implementation of this
 method prints the exception's stack trace to System.err and
 terminates the thread; it does not cause the virtual machine to exit or
 halt.

  In rare circumstances the virtual machine may abort, that is,
 stop running without shutting down cleanly.  This occurs when the
 virtual machine is terminated externally, for example with the
 SIGKILL signal on Unix or the TerminateProcess call on
 Microsoft Windows.  The virtual machine may also abort if a native
 method goes awry by, for example, corrupting internal data structures or
 attempting to access nonexistent memory.  If the virtual machine aborts
 then no guarantee can be made about whether or not any shutdown hooks
 will be run.

Parameters:
hook - An initialized but unstarted Thread object
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - If the specified hook has already been registered,
          or if it can be determined that the hook is already running or
          has already been run
IllegalStateException - If the virtual machine is already in the process
          of shutting down
SecurityException - If a security manager is present and it denies
          RuntimePermission("shutdownHooks")

exit
public void exit(int status)
Terminates the currently running Java virtual machine by initiating its
 shutdown sequence.  This method never returns normally.  The argument
 serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status code indicates
 abnormal termination.

  All registered shutdown hooks, if any,
 are started in some unspecified order and allowed to run concurrently
 until they finish.  Once this is done the virtual machine
 halts.

  If this method is invoked after all shutdown hooks have already
 been run and the status is nonzero then this method halts the
 virtual machine with the given status code. Otherwise, this method
 blocks indefinitely.

  The System.exit method is the
 conventional and convenient means of invoking this method.

Parameters:
status - Termination status.  By convention, a nonzero status code
         indicates abnormal termination.
Throws:
SecurityException - If a security manager is present and its
         checkExit method does not permit

Also, calling `exit(int status)` from the main thread of the application will not work as expected. The JVM will not allow the main thread to call `exit(int status)`.

 its best effort to recycle all discarded objects.

The `checkPermission` method is called with a `RuntimePermission` object that represents the permission we want to check. If the permission is granted, it prints "Permission granted". If the permission is denied, it catches the `SecurityException` and prints "Permission denied". If there is no `SecurityManager` present, it prints "No security manager is present".

Please replace `"createClassLoader"` with the actual permission you want to check. The list of available permissions can be found in the Java documentation.

checkPermission
public void checkPermission(Permission perm,
                            Object context)
Throws a SecurityException if the
 specified security context is denied access to the resource
 specified by the given permission.
 The context must be a security
 context returned by a previous call to
 getSecurityContext and the access control
 decision is based upon the configured security policy for
 that security context.
 
 If context is an instance of
 AccessControlContext then the
 AccessControlContext.checkPermission method is
 invoked with the specified permission.
 
 If context is not an instance of
 AccessControlContext then a
 SecurityException is thrown.

Parameters:
perm - the specified permission
context - a system-dependent security context.
Throws:
SecurityException - if the specified security context
             is not an instance of AccessControlContext
             (e.g., is null), or is denied access to the
             resource specified by the given permission.
NullPointerException - if the permission argument is

 This method computes the phase theta by computing an arc tangent
 of y/x in the range of -pi to pi. Special
 cases:
 If either argument is NaN, then the result is NaN.
 If the first argument is positive zero and the second argument
 is positive, or the first argument is positive and finite and the
 second argument is positive infinity, then the result is positive
 zero.
 If the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
 is positive, or the first argument is negative and finite and the
 second argument is positive infinity, then the result is negative zero.
 If the first argument is positive zero and the second argument
 is negative, or the first argument is positive and finite and the

 If the first argument is positive and the second argument is
 positive zero or negative zero, or the first argument is positive
 infinity and the second argument is finite, then the result is the
 double value closest to pi/2.
 If the first argument is negative and the second argument is
 positive zero or negative zero, or the first argument is negative
 infinity and the second argument is finite, then the result is the
 double value closest to -pi/2.
 If both arguments are positive infinity, then the result is the
 double value closest to pi/4.
 If the first argument is positive infinity and the second argument
 is negative infinity, then the result is the double
 value closest to 3*pi/4.
 If the first argument is negative infinity and the second argument
 is positive infinity, then the result is the double value
 closest to -pi/4.
 If both arguments are negative infinity, then the result is the
 double value closest to -3*pi/4.

Parameters:
y - the ordinate coordinate
x - the abscissa coordinate
Returns:
the theta component of the point
          (r, theta)

In this code snippet, we are calculating the angle `theta` from the conversion of rectangular coordinates (`x`, `y`) to polar coordinates. The `atan2` method is a part of `java.lang.StrictMath` class and it computes the phase `theta` by computing an arc tangent of `y/x` in the range of `-pi` to `pi`.

The `atan2` method takes two arguments: `y` and `x`. The `y` argument is the ordinate coordinate and the `x` argument is the abscissa coordinate. The method returns the `theta` component of the point (`r`, `theta`) in polar coordinates that corresponds to the point (`x`, `y`) in Cartesian coordinates.

In the `main` method, we are setting `y` and `x` to `1.0` and then calling the `atan2` method with these values. The result is stored in the `theta` variable and then printed to the console.

 argument is a positive finite odd integer,
 
 then the result is negative infinity.

 If the first argument is finite and less than zero
 
 if the second argument is a finite even integer, the
 result is equal to the result of raising the absolute value of
 the first argument to the power of the second argument

 if the second argument is a finite odd integer, the result
 is equal to the negative of the result of raising the absolute
 value of the first argument to the power of the second
 argument

 if the second argument is finite and not an integer, then
 the result is NaN.
 
If both arguments are integers, then the result is exactly equal
 to the mathematical result of raising the first argument to the power
 of the second argument if that result can in fact be represented
 exactly as a double value.
(In the foregoing descriptions, a floating-point value is
 considered to be an integer if and only if it is finite and a
 fixed point of the method ceil or,
 equivalently, a fixed point of the method floor. A value is a fixed point of a one-argument
 method if and only if the result of applying the method to the
 value is equal to the value.)

Parameters:
a - base.
b - the exponent.
Returns:
the value ab.

random
public static double random()
Returns a double value with a positive sign, greater
 than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.
 Returned values are chosen pseudorandomly with (approximately)
 uniform distribution from that range.

 When this method is first called, it creates a single new
 pseudorandom-number generator, exactly as if by the expression

 new java.util.Random()

 This new pseudorandom-number generator is used thereafter for
 all calls to this method and is used nowhere else.

 This method is properly synchronized to allow correct use by
 more than one thread. However, if many threads need to generate
 pseudorandom numbers at a great rate, it may reduce contention
 for each thread to have its own pseudorandom-number generator.

Returns:
a pseudorandom double greater than or equal
 to 0.0 and less than 1.0.

toLowerCase
public String toLowerCase()
Converts all of the characters in this String to lower
 case using the rules of the default locale. This is equivalent to calling
 toLowerCase(Locale.getDefault()).
 
Note: This method is locale sensitive, and may produce unexpected
 results if used for strings that are intended to be interpreted locale
 independently.
 Examples are programming language identifiers, protocol keys, and HTML
 tags.
 For instance, "TITLE".toLowerCase() in a Turkish locale
 returns "t\u0131tle", where '\u0131' is the
 LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I character.
 To obtain correct results for locale insensitive strings, use
 toLowerCase(Locale.ROOT).
 

Returns:
the String, converted to lowercase.

Here is the complete code snippet of the `toLowerCase()` method from the `java.lang.String` class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "HELLO WORLD";
        String lowerCaseStr = str.toLowerCase();
        System.out.println(lowerCaseStr);

In this code snippet, we create a `String` object `str` with the value "HELLO WORLD". We then call the `toLowerCase()` method on `str`, which converts all the characters in `str` to lower case. The result is stored in the `lowerCaseStr` variable, which is then printed to the console.

The output of this program will be:

```
hello world

trim
public String trim()
Returns a string whose value is this string, with any leading and trailing
 whitespace removed.
 
 If this String object represents an empty character
 sequence, or the first and last characters of character sequence
 represented by this String object both have codes
 greater than '\u0020' (the space character), then a
 reference to this String object is returned.
 
 Otherwise, if there is no character with a code greater than
 '\u0020' in the string, then a
 String object representing an empty string is
 returned.
 
 Otherwise, let k be the index of the first character in the
 string whose code is greater than '\u0020', and let
 m be the index of the last character in the string whose code
 is greater than '\u0020'. A String
 object is returned, representing the substring of this string that
 begins with the character at index k and ends with the
 character at index m-that is, the result of
 this.substring(k, m + 1).
 
 This method may be used to trim whitespace (as defined above) from
 the beginning and end of a string.

Returns:
A string whose value is this string, with any leading and trailing white
          space removed, or this string if it has no leading or

Here is a complete code snippet of the `substring` method from the `java.lang.String` class:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String str = "hamburger";
        String sub = str.substring(4, 8);
        System.out.println(sub);
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a `String` object `str` and call the `substring` method on it. The `substring` method is used to extract a part of the string from the index 4 to 7 (exclusive). The result is then printed to the console.

The `substring` method throws an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` if the `beginIndex` is negative, or if `endIndex` is larger than the length of the string, or if `beginIndex` is larger than `endIndex`.

Returns a string resulting from replacing all occurrences of
 oldChar in this string with newChar.
 
 If the character oldChar does not occur in the
 character sequence represented by this String object,
 then a reference to this String object is returned.
 Otherwise, a String object is returned that
 represents a character sequence identical to the character sequence
 represented by this String object, except that every
 occurrence of oldChar is replaced by an occurrence
 of newChar.
 
 Examples:
 
 "mesquite in your cellar".replace('e', 'o')

The `join` method is a static method of the `String` class, so it can be called directly on the `String` class without creating an instance of the `String` class.

The `join` method is overloaded, meaning it can be used with different types of arguments. In this case, it is used with a `CharSequence` delimiter and a variable number of `CharSequence` elements. The `CharSequence` interface is a supertype of `String`, so any `String` can be used as an argument.

The `join` method throws a `NullPointerException` if the delimiter or any of the elements is null. This is because it is not possible to join a null element with a delimiter.

The `join` method is available since Java 1.8.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `insert` method from `java.lang.StringBuffer`:

```java

In this code, we create a new `StringBuffer` object with the string "Hello". Then we call the `insert` method on this object, inserting the string "World" at the index 1. The result is that the string "Hello" becomes "HWorldello".

reverse
public StringBuffer reverse()
Causes this character sequence to be replaced by the reverse of
 the sequence. If there are any surrogate pairs included in the
 sequence, these are treated as single characters for the
 reverse operation. Thus, the order of the high-low surrogates
 is never reversed.

 Let n be the character length of this character sequence
 (not the length in char values) just prior to
 execution of the reverse method. Then the
 character at index k in the new character sequence is
 equal to the character at index n-k-1 in the old
 character sequence.

 Note that the reverse operation may result in producing
 surrogate pairs that were unpaired low-surrogates and
 high-surrogates before the operation. For example, reversing
 "\uDC00\uD800" produces "\uD800\uDC00" which is
 a valid surrogate pair.

Returns:

Here is the full description of the method: 


reverse
public StringBuilder reverse()
Causes this character sequence to be replaced by the reverse of
 the sequence. If there are any surrogate pairs included in the
 sequence, these are treated as single characters for the
 reverse operation. Thus, the order of the high-low surrogates
 is never reversed.

 Let n be the character length of this character sequence
 (not the length in char values) just prior to
 execution of the reverse method. Then the
 character at index k in the new character sequence is
 equal to the character at index n-k-1 in the old
 character sequence.

 Note that the reverse operation may result in producing
 surrogate pairs that were unpaired low-surrogates and
 high-surrogates before the operation. For example, reversing
 "\uDC00\uD800" produces "\uD800\uDC00" which is
 a valid surrogate pair.

Returns:
a reference to this object.

In this code snippet, we first create a `StringBuilder` object with the string "Hello". Then we print the string before and after reversing it. The `reverse()` method reverses the characters in the `StringBuilder` object.

Copies an array from the specified source array, beginning at the

 A subsequence of array components are copied from the source
 array referenced by src to the destination array
 referenced by dest. The number of components copied is
 equal to the length argument. The components at
 positions srcPos through
 srcPos+length-1 in the source array are copied into
 positions destPos through
 destPos+length-1, respectively, of the destination
 array.
 
 If the src and dest arguments refer to the

 components at positions srcPos through
 srcPos+length-1 were first copied to a temporary
 array with length components and then the contents of
 the temporary array were copied into positions
 destPos through destPos+length-1 of the

 The dest argument refers to an object that is not an

 The src argument refers to an array with a reference
    component type and the dest argument refers to an array

 Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an
 IndexOutOfBoundsException is
 thrown and the destination is not modified:
 
The srcPos argument is negative.
 The destPos argument is negative.
 The length argument is negative.
 srcPos+length is greater than
     src.length, the length of the source array.
 destPos+length is greater than
     dest.length, the length of the destination array.
 

 Otherwise, if any actual component of the source array from
 position srcPos through
 srcPos+length-1 cannot be converted to the component
 type of the destination array by assignment conversion, an
 ArrayStoreException is thrown. In this case, let
 k be the smallest nonnegative integer less than
 length such that src[srcPos+k]
 cannot be converted to the component type of the destination
 array; when the exception is thrown, source array components from
 positions srcPos through
 srcPos+k-1
 will already have been copied to destination array positions
 destPos through
 destPos+k-1 and no other
 positions of the destination array will have been modified.

src - the source array.
srcPos - starting position in the source array.
dest - the destination array.
destPos - starting position in the destination data.
length - the number of array elements to be copied.
Throws:

Please note that the garbage collection process is not guaranteed to run immediately after the `gc()` method is called. The garbage collector may run at any time, depending on the JVM's garbage collection algorithm.

Also, the `gc()` method is not a part of the `java.util.ArrayList` class. It's a method of the `java.lang.System` class.

exit
public static void exit(int status)
Terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine. The
 argument serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status
 code indicates abnormal termination.
 
 This method calls the exit method in class
 Runtime. This method never returns normally.
 
 The call System.exit(n) is effectively equivalent to
 the call:
 
 Runtime.getRuntime().exit(n)
 

Parameters:
status - exit status.
Throws:
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and its checkExit
        method doesn't allow exit with the specified status.

@@ Response
Here is a simple code snippet that demonstrates the use of `System.exit(int status)`:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Before exit");
        System.exit(0);
        System.out.println("After exit");
    }
}
```

In this code, the `System.exit(0)` call terminates the JVM, and the `System.out.println("After exit")` line will not be executed.

Please note that `System.exit(0)` is generally used in main methods of applications to indicate that the application has finished running successfully. If you use `System.exit(1)`, it indicates that the application has finished running with an error.

After that, we print "Hello, World!". The first time, it will be printed in uppercase because we changed the `System.out`. The second time, it will be printed in lowercase because we restored the original `System.out`.

Here is a complete code snippet of the destroy() method from java.lang.ThreadGroup:

```java
import java.lang.ThreadGroup;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThreadGroup tg = new ThreadGroup("MyThreadGroup");
        Thread t1 = new Thread(tg, "Thread1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(tg, "Thread2");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        try {

        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        tg.destroy();
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a new ThreadGroup and two threads. We start both threads and then we wait for 1 second. After that, we call the destroy() method on the ThreadGroup.

Please note that calling the destroy() method on a ThreadGroup will terminate all the threads in that group. If you want to destroy a specific thread, you should call the destroy() method on that thread's ThreadGroup.

printStackTrace
public void printStackTrace()
Prints this throwable and its backtrace to the
 standard error stream. This method prints a stack trace for this
 Throwable object on the error output stream that is
 the value of the field System.err. The first line of
 output contains the result of the toString() method for
 this object.  Remaining lines represent data previously recorded by
 the method fillInStackTrace(). The format of this

         at MyClass.crunch(MyClass.java:6)

 class MyClass {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         crunch(null);
     }
     static void crunch(int[] a) {

     }
     static void mash(int[] b) {
         System.out.println(b[0]);
     }
 }
 
 The backtrace for a throwable with an initialized, non-null cause
 should generally include the backtrace for the cause.  The format
 of this information depends on the implementation, but the following
 example may be regarded as typical:
 
 HighLevelException: MidLevelException: LowLevelException
         at Junk.a(Junk.java:13)
         at Junk.main(Junk.java:4)
 Caused by: MidLevelException: LowLevelException

         at Junk.d(Junk.java:27)
         at Junk.c(Junk.java:21)
         ... 3 more
 
 Note the presence of lines containing the characters "...".
 These lines indicate that the remainder of the stack trace for this
 exception matches the indicated number of frames from the bottom of the
 stack trace of the exception that was caused by this exception (the
 "enclosing" exception).  This shorthand can greatly reduce the length
 of the output in the common case where a wrapped exception is thrown
 from same method as the "causative exception" is caught.  The above
 example was produced by running the program:
 
 public class Junk {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
         try {
             a();
         } catch(HighLevelException e) {
             e.printStackTrace();
         }
     }
     static void a() throws HighLevelException {
         try {
             b();
         } catch(MidLevelException e) {
             throw new HighLevelException(e);
         }
     }
     static void b() throws MidLevelException {
         c();
     }
     static void c() throws MidLevelException {
         try {
             d();
         } catch(LowLevelException e) {
             throw new MidLevelException(e);
         }
     }
     static void d() throws LowLevelException {
        e();
     }
     static void e() throws LowLevelException {
         throw new LowLevelException();
     }
 }

 class HighLevelException extends Exception {
     HighLevelException(Throwable cause) { super(cause); }
 }

 class MidLevelException extends Exception {
     MidLevelException(Throwable cause)  { super(cause); }
 }

 class LowLevelException extends Exception {
 }
 
 As of release 7, the platform supports the notion of
 suppressed exceptions (in conjunction with the try-with-resources statement). Any exceptions that were
 suppressed in order to deliver an exception are printed out
 beneath the stack trace.  The format of this information
 depends on the implementation, but the following example may be
 regarded as typical:

 
 Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Something happened
  at Foo.bar(Foo.java:10)
  at Foo.main(Foo.java:5)
  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 0
          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
          at Foo.bar(Foo.java:9)
          ... 1 more
 
 Note that the "... n more" notation is used on suppressed exceptions
 just at it is used on causes. Unlike causes, suppressed exceptions are
 indented beyond their "containing exceptions."

 An exception can have both a cause and one or more suppressed
 exceptions:
 
 Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Main block
  at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:7)
  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 2
          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
          at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
          at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
 Caused by: java.lang.Exception: I did it
  at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:8)
 
 Likewise, a suppressed exception can have a cause:
 
 Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Main block
  at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:6)
  Suppressed: Resource2$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
          at Resource2.close(Resource2.java:20)
          at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:5)
  Caused by: java.lang.Exception: Rats, you caught me

In this example, we are throwing an exception and catching it. We then create a `StringWriter` and a `PrintWriter` that write to the `StringWriter`. We call `printStackTrace(pw)` on the exception, which writes the stack trace to the `PrintWriter`. Finally, we print the contents of the `StringWriter` to the console.

Please note that this is a simple example and in a real-world application, you would probably not want to print the stack trace to the console. Instead, you would probably want to log it to a file or send it to a logging service.
