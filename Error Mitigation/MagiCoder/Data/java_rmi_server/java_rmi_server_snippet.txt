For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `equals` method from `java.rmi.server.ObjID`:

```java
import java.rmi.server.ObjID;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ObjID objID1 = new ObjID();
        ObjID objID2 = new ObjID();

        System.out.println(objID1.equals(objID2));
    }
}
```

In this code, we create two `ObjID` objects and then use the `equals` method to compare them. The `equals` method returns `true` if the two `ObjID` objects are the same, and `false` otherwise.

Please note that the `ObjID` class is not part of the standard Java API, it's a part of the RMI (Remote Method Invocation) API. It's used internally by the RMI framework to identify remote objects.

The `hashCode()` method in `java.rmi.server.ObjID` returns the object number. The object number is a unique identifier for each object in the JVM.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `hashCode()` method:

The `equals(Object obj)` method in `java.rmi.server.RemoteObject` is used to compare two remote objects for equality. It is overridden in the `java.lang.Object` class.

Here is a complete code snippet of this method:

```java
import java.rmi.server.RemoteObject;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RemoteObject obj1 = new RemoteObject() {

        boolean isEqual = obj1.equals(obj2);
        System.out.println("Are obj1 and obj2 equal? " + isEqual);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create two instances of `RemoteObject` and then use the `equals()` method to compare them. The result is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `RemoteObject` class is abstract and cannot be instantiated directly. Therefore, we create an anonymous subclass of `RemoteObject` to demonstrate the usage of the `equals()` method. In a real-world scenario, you would likely use a more specific subclass of `RemoteObject`, such as `UnicastRemoteObject` or `ExportedObject`.
