equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Checks two PrivateCredentialPermission objects for
 equality.  Checks that obj is a
 PrivateCredentialPermission,
 and has the same credential class as this object,
 as well as the same Principals as this object.
 The order of the Principals in the respective Permission's
 target names is not relevant.

 

Specified by:
equals in class Permission
Parameters:
obj - the object we are testing for equality with this object.
Returns:
true if obj is a PrivateCredentialPermission,
          has the same credential class as this object,
          and has the same Principals as this object.

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java

Here is a complete code snippet of the `equals` method from `javax.security.auth.PrivateCredentialPermission`:

```java
import javax.security.auth.PrivateCredentialPermission;
import java.security.Principal;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Principal principal1 = new Principal() {
            @Override
            public String getName() {
                return "user1";
            }
        };
        Principal principal2 = new Principal() {
            @Override
            public String getName() {
                return "user2";
            }
        };

        PrivateCredentialPermission permission1 = new PrivateCredentialPermission("class1", new Principal[]{principal1, principal2});
        PrivateCredentialPermission permission2 = new PrivateCredentialPermission("class1", new Principal[]{principal2, principal1});

        System.out.println(permission1.equals(permission2)); // Output: true
    }
}
```

In this code, we create two `PrivateCredentialPermission` objects with different Principals but the same credential class. We then call the `equals` method on these objects, which checks if they are equal based on the credential class and the Principals. Since the order of the Principals does not matter, the output is `true`.

The `hashCode()` method is a part of the `Object` class in Java. It is used to get the hash code of the object. The hash code of an object is a unique integer value that is used to identify the object in a hash-based collection.

Here is a simple example of how to use the `hashCode()` method:

```java
import javax.security.auth.PrivateCredentialPermission;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PrivateCredentialPermission permission = new PrivateCredentialPermission("subject", "credential");
        int hashCode = permission.hashCode();
        System.out.println("Hash code: " + hashCode);
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `PrivateCredentialPermission` object and call the `hashCode()` method on it. The hash code of the permission is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `hashCode()` method is not typically used directly in your code. It is used internally by Java's hash-based collections (like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, etc.) to quickly locate objects in the collection.

Here is the complete code snippet of the method getActions() from javax.security.auth.PrivateCredentialPermission:

```java
import javax.security.auth.PrivateCredentialPermission;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PrivateCredentialPermission permission = new PrivateCredentialPermission("subject", "actions");
        System.out.println(permission.getActions());
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a new instance of PrivateCredentialPermission with a subject and actions. Then we call the getActions() method on this instance, which returns the actions as a string.

Please note that the getActions() method always returns "read" as specified in the JavaDoc. This is because the PrivateCredentialPermission class is used to protect access to private Credentials belonging to a particular Subject, and the "read" action is typically used to access these credentials.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `isReadOnly()` method from the `javax.security.auth.Subject` package:

```java
import javax.security.auth.Subject;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Subject subject = new Subject();
        boolean isReadOnly = subject.isReadOnly();
        System.out.println("Is the Subject read-only? " + isReadOnly);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new `Subject` object and call the `isReadOnly()` method. The `isReadOnly()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the Subject is read-only or not. The result is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `isReadOnly()` method is not part of the `Subject` class, but it is a method of the `Subject` class. It is a method of the `Subject` class that returns a boolean value indicating whether the Subject is read-only or not.
