Here is the description of the package: Provides the class HTMLEditorKit and supporting classesfor creating HTML text editors.
Here is the description of the class: Support for defining the visual characteristics of HTML views being rendered.
Here is the full description of the method: 


addRule
public void addRule(String rule)
Adds a set of rules to the sheet.  The rules are expected to
 be in valid CSS format.  Typically this would be called as
 a result of parsing a <style> tag.



@@ Instruction
I want to learn how to use void addRule(String rule) from javax.swing.text.html.StyleSheet
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

@@ Response
Here is a complete code snippet of the `addRule` method from `javax.swing.text.html.StyleSheet`:

```java
import javax.swing.text.html.StyleSheet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StyleSheet styleSheet = new StyleSheet();
        styleSheet.addRule("body { color: red; }");
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new `StyleSheet` object and then call the `addRule` method to add a rule to the style sheet. The rule is a string in CSS format, which sets the color of the text in the body of the HTML to red.

Please note that the `StyleSheet` class is part of the `javax.swing.text.html` package, which is part of the Java Swing library. This means that you need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer to use this package.
