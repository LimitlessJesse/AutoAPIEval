Sample: 0 _BindingIteratorStub
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Context
Here is the description of the package: Provides a naming service for Java IDL.
Here is the description of the class: The BindingIterator interface allows a client to iterate through the bindings using the next_one or next_n operations.
Here is the full description of the method: 


destroy
public void destroy()
This operation destroys the iterator.

Specified by:
destroy in interface BindingIteratorOperations




@@ Instruction
I want to learn how to use void destroy() from org.omg.CosNaming._BindingIteratorStub
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

@@ Response
Here is a complete code snippet of the destroy() method from org.omg.CosNaming._BindingIteratorStub:

```java
import org.omg.CosNaming._BindingIteratorStub;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        _BindingIteratorStub stub = new _BindingIteratorStub();
        stub.destroy();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are creating a new instance of _BindingIteratorStub and then calling the destroy() method on it. The destroy() method is a void method, so it doesn't return any value. It simply performs some cleanup operation and then ends.

Please note that you need to have the necessary imports and the stub class _BindingIteratorStub should be available in your classpath. Also, the destroy() method is not a part of the standard Java API, it's a method provided by the stub class.
