Sample: 0 XPathFactory
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Context
Here is the description of the package: This package provides an object-model neutral API for theevaluation of XPath expressions and access to the evaluationenvironment.
Here is the description of the class: An XPathFactory instance can be used to create XPath objects.
Here is the full description of the method: 


newInstance
public static XPathFactory newInstance()
Get a new XPathFactory instance using the default object model,
 DEFAULT_OBJECT_MODEL_URI,
 the W3C DOM.
This method is functionally equivalent to:

   newInstance(DEFAULT_OBJECT_MODEL_URI)
 
Since the implementation for the W3C DOM is always available, this method will never fail.

Returns:
Instance of an XPathFactory.
Throws:
RuntimeException - When there is a failure in creating an
   XPathFactory for the default object model.

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is the complete code snippet of the XPathFactory newInstance() method:

```java
import javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        XPathFactory xPathFactory = XPathFactory.newInstance();
        System.out.println(xPathFactory);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are importing the XPathFactory class from the javax.xml.xpath package. We then call the newInstance() method on the XPathFactory class to get a new instance of XPathFactory. The instance is then printed to the console.

Please note that the XPathFactory.newInstance() method will always return an instance of XPathFactory, so there is no need to handle the possibility of a RuntimeException.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `newXPath()` method from `javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory`:

```java
import javax.xml.xpath.XPath;
import javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        XPathFactory xPathFactory = XPathFactory.newInstance();
        XPath xPath = xPathFactory.newXPath();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create an instance of `XPathFactory` using `XPathFactory.newInstance()`. Then we call the `newXPath()` method on this instance to create a new `XPath` object.

Please note that you need to have the necessary dependencies in your project to use the `javax.xml.xpath` package. If you are using Maven, you can add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId>
        <artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId>
        <version>2.3.1</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

If you are using Gradle, you can add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api:2.3.1'
}
```

Remember to replace the version number with the latest available version.
