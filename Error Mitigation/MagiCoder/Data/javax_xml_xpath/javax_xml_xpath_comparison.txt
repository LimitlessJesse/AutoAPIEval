@@ Context
Here is the description of the package This package provides an object-model neutral API for theevaluation of XPath expressions and access to the evaluationenvironment.
Here is the description of the class XPath constants.

@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants package from Java
Given the context, recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, 
Do not recommend methods inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
1. `XPathConstants.NODE`: This method returns a new Node object.
2. `XPathConstants.NODESET`: This method returns a new NodeSet object.
3. `XPathConstants.STRING`: This method returns a new String object.
4. `XPathConstants.NUMBER`: This method returns a new Number object.
5. `XPathConstants.BOOLEAN`: This method returns a new Boolean object.
