Code snippet:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

Here is a complete code snippet of the `getValue` method from `java.awt.event.AdjustmentEvent`:

```java
import java.awt.event.AdjustmentEvent;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AdjustmentEvent event = new AdjustmentEvent(null, AdjustmentEvent.ADJUSTMENT_PERFORMED, 50);
        int value = event.getValue();
        System.out.println("Value: " + value);
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a new `AdjustmentEvent` with a value of 50. Then we call the `getValue` method on this event and print the result.

Please note that the `AdjustmentEvent` constructor is used here for demonstration purposes. In a real-world application, you would not create an `AdjustmentEvent` directly. Instead, you would receive an `AdjustmentEvent` as a result of a user action, such as scrolling a scrollbar.

In this code, we create an `AWTEventListener` that overrides the `eventDispatched` method. We then add this listener to the event dispatch chain for mouse events. Finally, we simulate a mouse click event and the listener will print out the event details.

Please note that this is a simple example and may not work as expected in a real-world application. The `eventDispatched` method is typically used in conjunction with other AWT event handling mechanisms, such as `addAWTEventListener` and `removeAWTEventListener`.

@@ Context
Here is the description of the package: Provides interfaces and classes for dealing with differenttypes of events fired by AWT components.
Here is the description of the class: The root event class for all component-level input events.
Here is the full description of the method: 


getModifiersEx
public int getModifiersEx()
Returns the extended modifier mask for this event.
 
 Extended modifiers are the modifiers that ends with the _DOWN_MASK suffix,
 such as ALT_DOWN_MASK, BUTTON1_DOWN_MASK, and others.
 
 Extended modifiers represent the state of all modal keys,
 such as ALT, CTRL, META, and the mouse buttons just after
 the event occurred.
 
 For example, if the user presses button 1 followed by
 button 2, and then releases them in the same order,
 the following sequence of events is generated:
 
    MOUSE_PRESSED:  BUTTON1_DOWN_MASK
    MOUSE_PRESSED:  BUTTON1_DOWN_MASK | BUTTON2_DOWN_MASK
    MOUSE_RELEASED: BUTTON2_DOWN_MASK
    MOUSE_CLICKED:  BUTTON2_DOWN_MASK
    MOUSE_RELEASED:
    MOUSE_CLICKED:
 

 It is not recommended to compare the return value of this method
 using == because new modifiers can be added in the future.
 For example, the appropriate way to check that SHIFT and BUTTON1 are
 down, but CTRL is up is demonstrated by the following code:
 
    int onmask = SHIFT_DOWN_MASK | BUTTON1_DOWN_MASK;
    int offmask = CTRL_DOWN_MASK;
    if ((event.getModifiersEx() & (onmask | offmask)) == onmask) {
        ...
    }
 
 The above code will work even if new modifiers are added.

        ItemEvent event = new ItemEvent(null, ItemEvent.ITEM_STATE_CHANGED, null, 0, true);

In this code, we create a new `ItemEvent` object with a state change of `ITEM_STATE_CHANGED`. Then we call the `getStateChange()` method on this event object, which returns the state change.

Please note that the `ItemEvent` class is part of the `java.awt.event` package, so you need to import it to use it. The `getStateChange()` method is a part of the `ItemEvent` class, so you can call it on an `ItemEvent` object.

In this code, we create a `JCheckBox` and add an `ItemListener` to it. The `itemStateChanged()` method of the `ItemListener` is called whenever the state of the checkbox changes. If the checkbox is selected, it prints "Checkbox selected". If the checkbox is deselected, it prints "Checkbox deselected".

The `getItemSelectable()` method returns the originator of the event, which in this case is the `JCheckBox`.

            }
        };

        // Now you can use keyAdapter to listen to key events
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a new `KeyAdapter` and override the `keyPressed(KeyEvent e)` method. This method is called whenever a key is pressed. The `KeyEvent` object `e` contains information about the key that was pressed, such as the character that was typed.

Please note that you need to use this `KeyAdapter` in a component that listens for key events, such as a `JFrame` or `JPanel`. For example:

```java
JFrame frame = new JFrame();
frame.addKeyListener(keyAdapter);
frame.setVisible(true);
```

This will make the `KeyAdapter` listen to key events in the frame.

In this code, we create a `KeyEvent` object with a key pressed (`KEY_PRESSED`) and the key code is `VK_A` (which represents the 'A' key). Then we call the `getKeyLocation()` method on this event object and print the result.

The `getKeyLocation()` method returns the location of the key that originated this key event. The location is represented as a bit mask. The `KEY_LOCATION_UNKNOWN` constant is returned for `KEY_TYPED` events.

Please note that the `KeyEvent` class is part of the `java.awt.event` package, which is part of the Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) library. This library is used for creating graphical user interfaces in Java.

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

Here is a complete code snippet of the `mousePressed` method from `java.awt.event.MouseAdapter`:

```java
import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter;
import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MouseAdapter mouseAdapter = new MouseAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
                // Your code here
            }
        };
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a `MouseAdapter` and override the `mousePressed` method. Inside this method, you can put the code that you want to execute when the mouse button is pressed.

For example, you can print a message to the console:

```java
import java.awt.event.MouseAdapter;
import java.awt.event.MouseEvent;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MouseAdapter mouseAdapter = new MouseAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
                System.out.println("Mouse button pressed!");
            }
        };
    }
}
```

This will print "Mouse button pressed!" to the console every time the mouse button is pressed.

getButton
public int getButton()
Returns which, if any, of the mouse buttons has changed state.
 The returned value is ranged
 from 0 to the MouseInfo.getNumberOfButtons()
 value.
 The returned value includes at least the following constants:
 
 NOBUTTON
 BUTTON1
 BUTTON2
 BUTTON3

 It is allowed to use those constants to compare with the returned button number in the application.
 For example,
 
 if (anEvent.getButton() == MouseEvent.BUTTON1) {
 
 In particular, for a mouse with one, two, or three buttons this method may return the following values:
 
 0 (NOBUTTON)
  1 (BUTTON1)
  2 (BUTTON2)
  3 (BUTTON3)
 
 Button numbers greater then BUTTON3 have no constant identifier. So if a mouse with five buttons is
 installed, this method may return the following values:
 
 0 (NOBUTTON)
  1 (BUTTON1)
  2 (BUTTON2)
  3 (BUTTON3)
  4
  5
 

 Note: If support for extended mouse buttons is disabled by Java
 then the AWT event subsystem does not produce mouse events for the extended mouse
 buttons. So it is not expected that this method returns anything except NOBUTTON, BUTTON1,
 BUTTON2, BUTTON3.

Returns:
one of the values from 0 to MouseInfo.getNumberOfButtons()
         if support for the extended mouse buttons is enabled by Java.

getUnitsToScroll
public int getUnitsToScroll()
This is a convenience method to aid in the implementation of
 the common-case MouseWheelListener - to scroll a ScrollPane or
 JScrollPane by an amount which conforms to the platform settings.
 (Note, however, that ScrollPane and
 JScrollPane already have this functionality built in.)
 
 This method returns the number of units to scroll when scroll type is
 MouseWheelEvent.WHEEL_UNIT_SCROLL, and should only be called if
 getScrollType returns MouseWheelEvent.WHEEL_UNIT_SCROLL.
 
 Direction of scroll, amount of wheel movement,
 and platform settings for wheel scrolling are all accounted for.
 This method does not and cannot take into account value of the
 Adjustable/Scrollable unit increment, as this will vary among
 scrolling components.
 
 A simplified example of how this method might be used in a
 listener:
 
  mouseWheelMoved(MouseWheelEvent event) {
      ScrollPane sp = getScrollPaneFromSomewhere();
      Adjustable adj = sp.getVAdjustable()
      if (MouseWheelEvent.getScrollType() == WHEEL_UNIT_SCROLL) {
          int totalScrollAmount =
              event.getUnitsToScroll() *

Here is a complete code snippet of the `getUnitsToScroll` method from `java.awt.event.MouseWheelEvent`:

```java
import java.awt.event.MouseWheelEvent;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MouseWheelEvent event = new MouseWheelEvent(null, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, false, MouseWheelEvent.WHEEL_UNIT_SCROLL);
        int unitsToScroll = event.getUnitsToScroll();
        System.out.println("Units to scroll: " + unitsToScroll);
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a `MouseWheelEvent` with a scroll type of `WHEEL_UNIT_SCROLL`. Then we call the `getUnitsToScroll` method on this event, which returns the number of units to scroll based on the direction and amount of mouse wheel rotation, and on the wheel scrolling settings of the native platform.

Please note that the `MouseWheelEvent` constructor arguments are placeholders and do not represent a real mouse wheel event. The `getUnitsToScroll` method is a static method, so it can be called directly on the `MouseWheelEvent` class without creating an instance of the class.

getWheelRotation
public int getWheelRotation()
Returns the number of "clicks" the mouse wheel was rotated, as an integer.
 A partial rotation may occur if the mouse supports a high-resolution wheel.
 In this case, the method returns zero until a full "click" has been accumulated.

Returns:
negative values if the mouse wheel was rotated up/away from
 the user, and positive values if the mouse wheel was rotated down/
 towards the user

Please note that you need to add the listener to the window to make it work. The line `window.addWindowFocusListener(windowAdapter);` is commented out because you need to replace `window` with your actual window object.

@@ Instruction
I want to learn how to use void windowStateChanged(WindowEvent e) from java.awt.event.WindowAdapter
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

@@ Response
Here is a complete code snippet of the `windowStateChanged` method from `java.awt.event.WindowAdapter`:

```java
import java.awt.event.WindowAdapter;
import java.awt.event.WindowEvent;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WindowAdapter windowAdapter = new WindowAdapter() {
            @Override
            public void windowStateChanged(WindowEvent e) {
                // Your code here
            }
        };
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new `WindowAdapter` and override the `windowStateChanged` method. This method is called whenever the state of the window changes. You can put your code inside this method to handle the event.

Please note that you need to replace `// Your code here` with your actual code. This is a placeholder and will not be executed.
