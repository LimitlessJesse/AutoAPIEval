createMessage
public abstract SOAPMessage createMessage()
                                   throws SOAPException
Creates a new SOAPMessage object with the default
 SOAPPart, SOAPEnvelope, SOAPBody,
 and SOAPHeader objects. Profile-specific message factories
 can choose to prepopulate the SOAPMessage object with
 profile-specific headers.
 
 Content can be added to this message's SOAPPart object, and
 the message can be sent "as is" when a message containing only a SOAP part
 is sufficient. Otherwise, the SOAPMessage object needs
 to create one or more AttachmentPart objects and
 add them to itself. Any content that is not in XML format must be
 in an AttachmentPart object.

Returns:
a new SOAPMessage object
Throws:
SOAPException - if a SOAP error occurs
UnsupportedOperationException - if the protocol of this
      MessageFactory instance is DYNAMIC_SOAP_PROTOCOL

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");

Here is a simple example of how to use the `createMessage()` method from the `javax.xml.soap.MessageFactory` class:

```java
import javax.xml.soap.MessageFactory;
import javax.xml.soap.SOAPException;
import javax.xml.soap.SOAPMessage;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Create a MessageFactory
            MessageFactory factory = MessageFactory.newInstance();

            // Create a new SOAPMessage
            SOAPMessage message = factory.createMessage();

            // Print the SOAPMessage
            System.out.println(message.toString());
        } catch (SOAPException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we first create a new instance of the `MessageFactory` class. Then, we use the `createMessage()` method to create a new `SOAPMessage`. Finally, we print the `SOAPMessage` to the console.

Please note that the `createMessage()` method does not actually create a SOAP message with any content. It just creates a new `SOAPMessage` object with the default `SOAPPart`, `SOAPEnvelope`, `SOAPBody`, and `SOAPHeader` objects. You would need to add content to the `SOAPMessage` before it can be sent.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `newInstance()` method from `javax.xml.soap.SOAPConnectionFactory`:

```java
import javax.xml.soap.SOAPConnection;
import javax.xml.soap.SOAPConnectionFactory;
import javax.xml.soap.SOAPException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {

        } catch (SOAPException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first import the necessary classes from the `javax.xml.soap` package. Then, we call the `newInstance()` method on the `SOAPConnectionFactory` class to create a new instance of the factory. After that, we use the `createConnection()` method to create a new `SOAPConnection` object. Finally, we close the connection when we're done.

Please note that the `createConnection()` method may throw a `SOAPException` if there is an error creating the connection. We catch this exception in the `main()` method and print the stack trace to the console.

createElement
public SOAPElement createElement(QName qname)
                          throws SOAPException
Creates a SOAPElement object initialized with the
 given QName object. The concrete type of the return value
 will depend on the name given to the new SOAPElement. For
 instance, a new SOAPElement with the name
 "{http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope}Envelope" would cause a
 SOAPEnvelope that supports SOAP 1.2 behavior to be created.

Parameters:
qname - a QName object with the XML name for
             the new element
Returns:
the new SOAPElement object that was
         created
Throws:
SOAPException - if there is an error in creating the

In this code snippet, we first create a new instance of `SOAPFactory`. Then, we create a new `QName` object with the namespace and local part of the element we want to create. Finally, we call the `createElement` method of `SOAPFactory`, passing the `QName` object as a parameter. The `SOAPElement` object is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `SOAPFactory.newInstance()` method can throw a `SOAPException`, so we wrap it in a try-catch block to handle any potential errors.

Please note that you need to handle the `SOAPException` in your code. The `throws SOAPException` in the method signature is used to indicate that this method may throw a `SOAPException`. If you don't handle this exception, you need to declare it in the method signature or in the method that calls this method.
