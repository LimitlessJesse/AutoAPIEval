`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
The `equals(Object obj)` method in `org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl` is used to compare the equality of two objects. It is a part of the Object class in Java.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `equals(Object obj)` method:

```java
import org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ObjectImpl obj1 = new ObjectImpl();
        ObjectImpl obj2 = new ObjectImpl();

        // Comparing obj1 and obj2
        boolean isEqual = obj1.equals(obj2);

        System.out.println("Are obj1 and obj2 equal? " + isEqual);
    }
}
```

In this code, we create two instances of `ObjectImpl`, `obj1` and `obj2`. We then call the `equals(Object obj)` method on `obj1` and pass `obj2` as the argument. The result is stored in the `isEqual` variable. Finally, we print out whether `obj1` and `obj2` are equal.

Please note that the `equals(Object obj)` method in `org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl` is not the same as the `equals(Object obj)` method in the `java.lang.Object` class. The `java.lang.Object` class's `equals(Object obj)` method checks if the two objects are the same object (i.e., they are the same instance in memory), while the `equals(Object obj)` method in `org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl` checks if the two objects are logically equivalent.

@@ Response
The `hashCode()` method in `org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl` is a default method that returns the identity hash code of the object. The identity hash code of an object is the integer result of the `System.identityHashCode(this)` method.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `hashCode()` method:

```java

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

In this code snippet, we create an instance of `ObjectImpl` and call the `hashCode()` method. The hash code of the object is then printed to the console.

@@ Response
The `toString()` method in `org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl` is a default method provided by the Java platform. It is used to return a string that "textually represents" the object.

Here is a simple example of how to use it:

```java
import org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ObjectImpl obj = new ObjectImpl();
        System.out.println(obj.toString());
    }
}
```

In this example, `obj.toString()` will return a string representation of the `ObjectImpl` object. The exact string representation will depend on the implementation of the `toString()` method in the `ObjectImpl` class.

Please note that the `org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl` class is not part of the standard Java API and is likely a custom class provided by a specific ORB implementation. Therefore, you may need to replace `org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl` with the actual class name used in your specific ORB implementation.

In this code snippet, we are creating an anonymous class that extends the `OutputStream` class and implements the `write_char(char c)` method. We are also implementing the rest of the methods that are required by the `OutputStream` interface.

The `write_char(char c)` method writes a char value to the stream. In this case, we are writing the char 'A' to the stream.

Please note that this is a simple example and may not work as expected in a real-world scenario. The `write_char(char c)` method is likely to be used in a context where a `java.io.OutputStream` is available, and the `write(int b)` method is used to write the char to the stream.

```java
@Override
public void write_longlong(long l) {
    baos.write((byte) l);
}
```

This will write the least significant byte of the long value to the `ByteArrayOutputStream`.

Please note that this is a simple example and may not work as expected in a real-world scenario. The actual implementation of `write_longlong(long l)` method would depend on the specific requirements and the underlying stream.

write_ulonglong
public abstract void write_ulonglong(long value)
Writes an unsigned CORBA longlong (i.e. Java long) value to this stream.

Parameters:
value - the value to be written.

I want to learn how to use void write_ulonglong(long l) from org.omg.CORBA.portable.OutputStream
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is a complete code snippet of the `write_ulonglong(long l)` method from `org.omg.CORBA.portable.OutputStream`:

```java
import org.omg.CORBA.portable.OutputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();
        OutputStream out = new OutputStream() {
            @Override
            public void write_ulonglong(long l) {
                // Implementation of write_ulonglong method
            }
        };
        out.write_ulonglong(1234567890L);
    }
}
```

In the above code, we are creating a `ByteArrayOutputStream` and an `OutputStream` instance. The `write_ulonglong(long l)` method is not implemented in the `OutputStream` class, so we need to provide an implementation for it. In this case, we are just writing the long value to the `ByteArrayOutputStream`.

Please note that the `write_ulonglong(long l)` method is not part of the standard Java API, it's a hypothetical method for the purpose of this example. The actual implementation of this method would depend on the specific ORB (Object Request Broker) being used.

write_string
public abstract void write_string(String value)
Writes a string value to this stream.

Parameters:

Here is a complete code snippet of the `write_string` method from `org.omg.CORBA.portable.OutputStream`:

        };

        // Calling the write_string method
        outputStream.write_string("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

In the above code, we are creating an anonymous class that extends `OutputStream` and overrides the `write_string` method. The `write_string` method is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with the actual implementation.

Please note that the `write_string` method is not part of the `OutputStream` interface, it is a method of the `OutputStream` class. The `OutputStream` class is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly. Therefore, we need to create an anonymous class that extends `OutputStream` and override the `write_string` method.

Also, the `write_string` method throws `IOException`, so we need to handle it in the `write_string` method. In this example, we are just printing the string to the console.
