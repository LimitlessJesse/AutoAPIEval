In this code snippet, we create an instance of `AbstractOwnableSynchronizer` and then we get the current thread using `Thread.currentThread()`. We then call the `setExclusiveOwnerThread(Thread thread)` method on our `AbstractOwnableSynchronizer` instance, passing in the current thread.

This code snippet does not do anything useful, but it demonstrates how to use the `setExclusiveOwnerThread(Thread thread)` method.

Here is the full description of the method: 


tryAcquire
protected boolean tryAcquire(int arg)
Attempts to acquire in exclusive mode. This method should query
 if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the
 exclusive mode, and if so to acquire it.

 This method is always invoked by the thread performing
 acquire.  If this method reports failure, the acquire method
 may queue the thread, if it is not already queued, until it is
 signalled by a release from some other thread. This can be used
 to implement method Lock.tryLock().

 The default
 implementation throws UnsupportedOperationException.

Parameters:
arg - the acquire argument. This value is always the one
        passed to an acquire method, or is the value saved on entry
        to a condition wait.  The value is otherwise uninterpreted
        and can represent anything you like.
Returns:
true if successful. Upon success, this object has
         been acquired.
Throws:
IllegalMonitorStateException - if acquiring would place this
         synchronizer in an illegal state. This exception must be
         thrown in a consistent fashion for synchronization to work
         correctly.
UnsupportedOperationException - if exclusive mode is not supported

Here is a simple example of how to use `parkUntil` method from `java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport`:

        System.out.println("Main thread is unparking the other thread");

In this example, we create a new thread and park it using `LockSupport.parkUntil`. After 500 milliseconds, we unpark the thread using `LockSupport.unpark`. The thread will continue execution after it is unparked.

parkNanos
public static void parkNanos(Object blocker,
                             long nanos)
Disables the current thread for thread scheduling purposes, for up to
 the specified waiting time, unless the permit is available.

 If the permit is available then it is consumed and the call
 returns immediately; otherwise the current thread becomes disabled
 for thread scheduling purposes and lies dormant until one of four
 things happens:

 
Some other thread invokes unpark with the
 current thread as the target; or

 Some other thread interrupts
 the current thread; or

 The specified waiting time elapses; or

 The call spuriously (that is, for no reason) returns.
 
This method does not report which of these caused the
 method to return. Callers should re-check the conditions which caused
 the thread to park in the first place. Callers may also determine,
 for example, the interrupt status of the thread, or the elapsed time
 upon return.

Parameters:
blocker - the synchronization object responsible for this
        thread parking
nanos - the maximum number of nanoseconds to wait
Since:

In this code snippet, we first create a new `ReentrantLock` object. Then we call the `lock()` method on this object. This method will either acquire the lock if it's not held by another thread, or increase the hold count if the current thread already holds the lock.

After performing the actions we want to protect, we call the `unlock()` method to release the lock. This method decreases the hold count of the lock. If the hold count reaches zero, the lock is released and other threads can acquire it.

It's important to always call `unlock()` in a `finally` block to ensure the lock is always released, even if an exception is thrown.

public boolean tryLock()
Acquires the lock only if it is not held by another thread at the time
 of invocation.

 Acquires the lock if it is not held by another thread and

 fair ordering policy, a call to tryLock() will
 immediately acquire the lock if it is available, whether or not
 other threads are currently waiting for the lock.
 This "barging" behavior can be useful in certain
 circumstances, even though it breaks fairness. If you want to honor
 the fairness setting for this lock, then use
 tryLock(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS) 
 which is almost equivalent (it also detects interruption).

 If the current thread already holds this lock then the hold

Acquires the lock if it is not held by another thread within the given
 waiting time and the current thread has not been
 interrupted.

 Acquires the lock if it is not held by another thread and returns
 immediately with the value true, setting the lock hold count
 to one. If this lock has been set to use a fair ordering policy then
 an available lock will not be acquired if any other threads
 are waiting for the lock. This is in contrast to the tryLock()
 method. If you want a timed tryLock that does permit barging on
 a fair lock then combine the timed and un-timed forms together:

   
 if (lock.tryLock() ||
     lock.tryLock(timeout, unit)) {
   ...
 }
If the current thread
 already holds this lock then the hold count is incremented by one and
 the method returns true.

 If the lock is held by another thread then the
 current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
 purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens:

 
The lock is acquired by the current thread; or

 Some other thread interrupts
 the current thread; or

 The specified waiting time elapses

 
If the lock is acquired then the value true is returned and
 the lock hold count is set to one.

 If the current thread:

 
has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

 is interrupted while
 acquiring the lock,

 
 then InterruptedException is thrown and the current thread's
 interrupted status is cleared.

 If the specified waiting time elapses then the value false
 is returned.  If the time is less than or equal to zero, the method
 will not wait at all.

tryLock
public boolean tryLock(long timeout,

Acquires the read lock if the write lock is not held by
 another thread within the given waiting time and the
 current thread has not been interrupted.

 Acquires the read lock if the write lock is not held by
 another thread and returns immediately with the value
 true. If this lock has been set to use a fair
 ordering policy then an available lock will not be
 acquired if any other threads are waiting for the
 lock. This is in contrast to the tryLock()
 method. If you want a timed tryLock that does
 permit barging on a fair lock then combine the timed and
 un-timed forms together:

   
 if (lock.tryLock() ||
     lock.tryLock(timeout, unit)) {
   ...
 }
If the write lock is held by another thread then the
 current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling
 purposes and lies dormant until one of three things happens:

 
The read lock is acquired by the current thread; or

 Some other thread interrupts
 the current thread; or

 The specified waiting time elapses.

 
If the read lock is acquired then the value true is
 returned.

 If the current thread:

 
has its interrupted status set on entry to this method; or

 is interrupted while
 acquiring the read lock,

  then InterruptedException is thrown and the
 current thread's interrupted status is cleared.

 If the specified waiting time elapses then the value
 false is returned.  If the time is less than or
 equal to zero, the method will not wait at all.

 In this implementation, as this method is an explicit
 interruption point, preference is given to responding to
 the interrupt over normal or reentrant acquisition of the
 lock, and over reporting the elapse of the waiting time.

 equal to zero, the method will not wait at all.

 In this implementation, as this method is an explicit
 interruption point, preference is given to responding to
 the interrupt over normal or reentrant acquisition of the
 lock, and over reporting the elapse of the waiting time.

Specified by:
tryLock in interface Lock
Parameters:
timeout - the time to wait for the write lock
unit - the time unit of the timeout argument
Returns:
true if the lock was free and was acquired
 by the current thread, or the write lock was already held by the
 current thread; and false if the waiting time
 elapsed before the lock could be acquired.
Throws:
InterruptedException - if the current thread is interrupted
NullPointerException - if the time unit is null

Here is a complete code snippet of the `unlock()` method from `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock`:

```

In this code snippet, we first create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. Then we get the `WriteLock` from the `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. We then lock the `WriteLock` and perform write operations. After the write operations are done, we unlock the `WriteLock`.

The `try-finally` block is used to ensure that the `WriteLock` is always unlocked, even if an exception is thrown. This is important because if the `WriteLock` is not unlocked, it can lead to a deadlock situation.

Here is the description of the class: The lock returned by method ReentrantReadWriteLock.writeLock().
Here is the full description of the method: 


newCondition
public Condition newCondition()
Returns a Condition instance for use with this
 Lock instance.
 The returned Condition instance supports the same
 usages as do the Object monitor methods (wait, notify, and notifyAll) when used with the built-in
 monitor lock.

 
If this write lock is not held when any Condition method is called then an IllegalMonitorStateException is thrown.  (Read locks are
 held independently of write locks, so are not checked or
 affected. However it is essentially always an error to
 invoke a condition waiting method when the current thread
 has also acquired read locks, since other threads that
 could unblock it will not be able to acquire the write
 lock.)

 When the condition waiting
 methods are called the write lock is released and, before
 they return, the write lock is reacquired and the lock hold
 count restored to what it was when the method was called.

 If a thread is interrupted while
 waiting then the wait will terminate, an InterruptedException will be thrown, and the thread's
 interrupted status will be cleared.

  Waiting threads are signalled in FIFO order.

 The ordering of lock reacquisition for threads returning
 from waiting methods is the same as for threads initially
 acquiring the lock, which is in the default case not specified,
 but for fair locks favors those threads that have been
 waiting the longest.

In this code snippet, we first create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. Then we acquire the write lock using `writeLock()` method. After that, we create a new condition using `newCondition()` method.

The `newCondition()` method returns a `Condition` object that can be used to wait and signal threads. It is similar to the `Object.wait()`, `Object.notify()`, and `Object.notifyAll()` methods, but it works with the lock held by the `WriteLock`.

The `Condition` object is used to wait and signal threads in a more flexible way than using `Object.wait()` and `Object.notify()`. It allows multiple threads to wait on the same condition, and it also allows threads to be woken up in a specific order.
