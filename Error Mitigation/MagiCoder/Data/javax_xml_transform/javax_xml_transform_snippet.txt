Here is the description of the class: A TransformerFactory instance can be used to create Transformer and Templates objects.
Here is the full description of the method: 


newInstance
public static TransformerFactory newInstance()
                                      throws TransformerFactoryConfigurationError
Obtain a new instance of a TransformerFactory.
 This static method creates a new factory instance.
This method uses the following ordered lookup procedure to determine
 the TransformerFactory implementation class to
 load:


 Use the javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory system
 property.
 

 Use the properties file "lib/jaxp.properties" in the JRE directory.
 This configuration file is in standard java.util.Properties
  format and contains the fully qualified name of the
 implementation class with the key being the system property defined
 above.
 
 The jaxp.properties file is read only once by the JAXP implementation
 and it's values are then cached for future use.  If the file does not exist
 when the first attempt is made to read from it, no further attempts are
 made to check for its existence.  It is not possible to change the value
 of any property in jaxp.properties after it has been read for the first time.
 

   Use the service-provider loading facilities, defined by the
   ServiceLoader class, to attempt to locate and load an
   implementation of the service using the default loading mechanism:
   the service-provider loading facility will use the current thread's context class loader
   to attempt to load the service. If the context class
   loader is null, the system class loader will be used.
 

   Otherwise, the system-default implementation is returned.
 

Once an application has obtained a reference to a 
 TransformerFactory it can use the factory to configure
 and obtain transformer instances.

Returns:
new TransformerFactory instance, never null.
Throws:
TransformerFactoryConfigurationError - Thrown in case of service configuration error or if
 the implementation is not available or cannot be instantiated.

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is a complete code snippet of the `newInstance()` method from `javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory`:

```java
import javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory;
import javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactoryConfigurationError;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            TransformerFactory factory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
            System.out.println(factory);
        } catch (TransformerFactoryConfigurationError e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are creating a new instance of `TransformerFactory` and printing it to the console. If an error occurs during the creation of the factory, it will be caught and printed to the console.

newTransformer
public abstract Transformer newTransformer()
                                    throws TransformerConfigurationException
Create a new Transformer that performs a copy
 of the Source to the Result.
 i.e. the "identity transform".

Returns:
A Transformer object that may be used to perform a transformation
 in a single thread, never null.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException - When it is not
   possible to create a Transformer instance.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `newTransformer` method from `javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory`:

```java
import javax.xml.transform.Transformer;
import javax.xml.transform.TransformerConfigurationException;
import javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            TransformerFactory factory = TransformerFactory.newInstance();
            Transformer transformer = factory.newTransformer();
            System.out.println(transformer);
        } catch (TransformerConfigurationException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `TransformerFactory` instance using `TransformerFactory.newInstance()`. Then we call `newTransformer()` on this instance to create a new `Transformer`.

Please note that the `newTransformer()` method does not actually perform any transformation. It simply creates a new `Transformer` object that can be used to perform a copy of the source to the result.

Also, the `newTransformer()` method can throw a `TransformerConfigurationException` if it is not possible to create a `Transformer` instance. In the code snippet, we catch this exception and print the stack trace.

newTemplates
public abstract Templates newTemplates(Source source)
                                throws TransformerConfigurationException
Process the Source into a Templates object, which is a
 a compiled representation of the source. This Templates object
 may then be used concurrently across multiple threads.  Creating
 a Templates object allows the TransformerFactory to do detailed
 performance optimization of transformation instructions, without
 penalizing runtime transformation.

Parameters:
source - An object that holds a URL, input stream, etc.
Returns:
A Templates object capable of being used for transformation
   purposes, never null.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException - When parsing to
   construct the Templates object fails.
