Here is the description of the package: Access to date and time using fields and units, and date time adjusters.
Here is the description of the class: Localized definitions of the day-of-week, week-of-month and week-of-year fields.
Here is the full description of the method: 


getFirstDayOfWeek
public DayOfWeek getFirstDayOfWeek()
Gets the first day-of-week.
 
 The first day-of-week varies by culture.
 For example, the US uses Sunday, while France and the ISO-8601 standard use Monday.
 This method returns the first day using the standard DayOfWeek enum.

Returns:
the first day-of-week, not null

I want to learn how to use DayOfWeek getFirstDayOfWeek() from java.time.temporal.WeekFields
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is the complete code snippet of the method getFirstDayOfWeek() from java.time.temporal.WeekFields:

```java
import java.time.DayOfWeek;
import java.time.temporal.WeekFields;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeekFields weekFields = WeekFields.of(DayOfWeek.MONDAY, 1);
        DayOfWeek firstDayOfWeek = weekFields.getFirstDayOfWeek();
        System.out.println("The first day of the week is: " + firstDayOfWeek);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first import the necessary classes. Then, we create an instance of WeekFields using the static method of() to specify the first day of the week and the minimum number of days the first week of the year should have. Finally, we call the getFirstDayOfWeek() method on the WeekFields instance to get the first day of the week. The result is printed to the console.

getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek
public int getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek()
Gets the minimal number of days in the first week.
 
 The number of days considered to define the first week of a month or year
 varies by culture.
 For example, the ISO-8601 requires 4 days (more than half a week) to
 be present before counting the first week.

Returns:
the minimal number of days in the first week of a month or year, from 1 to 7

In this code snippet, we first import the WeekFields class from java.time.temporal package. Then, we create an instance of WeekFields class by calling the static method of() and passing the first day of the week (Monday in this case) and the minimal number of days in the first week (1 in this case). Finally, we call the getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() method on the instance of WeekFields and print the result.

Please note that the first day of the week and the minimal number of days in the first week are arbitrary and can be changed according to the specific requirements.
