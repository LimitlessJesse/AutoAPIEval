Here is the description of the class TableColumnModelEvent is used to notify listeners that a table column model has changed, such as a column was added, removed, or moved.

@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.swing.event.TableColumnModelEvent package from Java
Given the context, recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, 
Do not recommend methods inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
1. `TableColumnModelEvent(Object source, int type, int column)`: This is the constructor of the TableColumnModelEvent class. It takes three parameters: the source of the event, the type of event, and the column index.

2. `int getColumn()`: This method returns the index of the column that triggered the event.

3. `int getFirstColumn()`: This method returns the index of the first column in the range of columns that triggered the event.

4. `int getLastColumn()`: This method returns the index of the last column in the range of columns that triggered the event.

5. `int getType()`: This method returns the type of event that occurred. The type is one of the constants defined in the TableColumnModelEvent class, such as `INSERT`, `REMOVE`, `MOVE`, etc.
