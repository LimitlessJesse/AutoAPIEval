 XMLEventReader.

Returns:
XMLStreamReader used by this

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is a complete code snippet of the method `getXMLStreamReader()` from the `javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXSource` class:

```java
import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader;
import javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXSource;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a StAXSource object
        StAXSource staxSource = new StAXSource();

        // Get the XMLStreamReader
        XMLStreamReader xmlStreamReader = staxSource.getXMLStreamReader();

        // Use the XMLStreamReader
        if (xmlStreamReader!= null) {
            // Perform operations using the XMLStreamReader
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `StAXSource` object. Then we call the `getXMLStreamReader()` method on this object to get the `XMLStreamReader`. We then use this `XMLStreamReader` to perform operations on the XML data.

Please note that the actual usage of the `XMLStreamReader` would depend on the specific requirements of your application.

Here is the full description of the method: 


setSystemId
public void setSystemId(String systemId)
In the context of a StAXSource, it is not appropriate
 to explicitly set the system identifier.
 The XMLStreamReader or XMLEventReader
 used to construct this StAXSource determines the
 system identifier of the XML source.
An UnsupportedOperationException is always
 thrown by this method.

Specified by:
setSystemId in interface Source
Parameters:
systemId - Ignored.
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException - Is always
   thrown by this method.

@@ Response
The `setSystemId` method in `StAXSource` is not meant to be used directly. It is used internally by the `StAXSource` to set the system identifier of the XML source.

Here is an example of how you might use `StAXSource`:

```java
import javax.xml.stream.XMLInputFactory;
import javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamReader;
import javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXSource;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        XMLInputFactory factory = XMLInputFactory.newInstance();
        XMLStreamReader reader = factory.createXMLStreamReader(new StringReader("<root>Hello</root>"));
        StAXSource source = new StAXSource(reader);

        // Now you can use source for transformation or other operations
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a new `StAXSource` from a `XMLStreamReader`. The `XMLStreamReader` is created from a `StringReader` which contains some XML data.

Note that the `setSystemId` method is not used in this example. It is not meant to be used directly, and attempting to use it will result in an `UnsupportedOperationException`.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `getSystemId()` method from the `javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXSource` class:

```java
import javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXSource;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        String systemId = source.getSystemId();
        System.out.println(systemId);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create an `XMLInputFactory` and a `XMLStreamReader` using the `createXMLStreamReader` method. Then we create a `StAXSource` using the `XMLStreamReader`. Finally, we call the `getSystemId` method on the `StAXSource` and print the result.

Please note that the `StringReader` is a class from the `java.io` package, and it is used here to create a reader for a string. In a real-world application, you would use a different kind of reader to read from a file or a network connection.
