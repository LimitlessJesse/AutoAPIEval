I want to learn how to use MBeanInfo getMBeanInfo() from javax.management.modelmbean.RequiredModelMBean
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is a complete code snippet of the `getMBeanInfo()` method from `javax.management.modelmbean.RequiredModelMBean`:

```java
import javax.management.MBeanInfo;
import javax.management.modelmbean.RequiredModelMBean;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RequiredModelMBean mbean = new RequiredModelMBean() {
            // Implement the methods here
        };

        MBeanInfo info = mbean.getMBeanInfo();
        // Use the info as needed
    }
}
```

In the above code, you need to implement the methods of `RequiredModelMBean` interface. The `getMBeanInfo()` method returns an instance of `MBeanInfo` which allows retrieval of all attributes, operations, and notifications of this MBean.

Please note that the `RequiredModelMBean` interface is an abstract class and you need to create a subclass of `RequiredModelMBean` and implement the methods of the interface.

setAttribute
public void setAttribute(Attribute attribute)
                  throws AttributeNotFoundException,
                         InvalidAttributeValueException,
                         MBeanException,
                         ReflectionException
Sets the value of a specific attribute of a named ModelMBean.

 If the 'setMethod' field of the attribute's descriptor
 contains the name of a valid operation descriptor, then the
 method described by the operation descriptor is executed.
 In this implementation, the operation descriptor must be specified
 correctly and assigned to the modelMBeanInfo so that the 'setMethod'
 works correctly.
 The response from the method is set as the value of the attribute
 in the descriptor.

 If currencyTimeLimit is > 0, then the new value for the
 attribute is cached in the attribute descriptor's
 'value' field and the 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' field is set to
 the current time stamp.

 If the persist field of the attribute's descriptor is not null
 then Persistence policy from the attribute descriptor is used to
 guide storing the attribute in a persistent store.
 Store the MBean if 'persistPolicy' field is:
 
 != "never"
 = "always"
 = "onUpdate"
 = "onTimer" and now > 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod'
 = "NoMoreOftenThan" and now > 'lastPersistTime' +
         'persistPeriod'

 Do not store the MBean if 'persistPolicy' field is:
 
 = "never"
 = = "onTimer" && now < 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod'
 = "onUnregister"
 = = "NoMoreOftenThan" and now < 'lastPersistTime' +
        'persistPeriod'

The ModelMBeanInfo of the Model MBean is stored in a file.

Specified by:
setAttribute in interface DynamicMBean
Parameters:
attribute - The Attribute instance containing the name of
        the attribute to be set and the value it is to be set to.
Throws:
AttributeNotFoundException - The specified attribute is
   not accessible in the MBean.
   The following cases may result in an AttributeNotFoundException:
   
 No ModelMBeanAttributeInfo is found for the specified
          attribute.
 The ModelMBeanAttributeInfo's isWritable method returns
          'false'.

InvalidAttributeValueException - No descriptor is defined
   for the specified attribute.
MBeanException - Wraps one of the following Exceptions:
   
 An Exception thrown by the managed object's setter.
 A ServiceNotFoundException if a setMethod field is
          defined in the descriptor for the attribute and the managed
          resource is null; or if no setMethod field is defined and
          caching is not enabled for the attribute.
          Note that if there is no getMethod field either, then caching
          is automatically enabled.
 InvalidTargetObjectTypeException The 'targetType'
          field value is not 'objectReference'.
 An Exception thrown by the managed object's getter.

ReflectionException - Wraps an Exception
   thrown while trying to invoke the setter.
RuntimeOperationsException - Wraps an
   IllegalArgumentException: The attribute in parameter is
   null.

The `setAttribute` method is not a part of the `RequiredModelMBean` interface. It is a part of the `ModelMBean` interface.

Here is a simple example of how you can use the `setAttribute` method:

```java
import javax.management.*;
import javax.management.modelmbean.RequiredModelMBean;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create a new MBean server
        MBeanServer mbs = ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();

        // Create a new MBean
        ObjectName name = new ObjectName("com.example:type=MyMBean");
        MyMBean mbean = new MyMBean();
        mbs.registerMBean(mbean, name);

        // Create an Attribute

getAttribute
public Object getAttribute(String attrName)
                    throws AttributeNotFoundException,
                           MBeanException,
                           ReflectionException
Returns the value of a specific attribute defined for this
 ModelMBean.
 The last value returned by an attribute may be cached in the
 attribute's descriptor.
 The valid value will be in the 'value' field if there is one.
 If the 'currencyTimeLimit' field in the descriptor is:
 
 <0 Then the value is not cached and is never valid.
       The getter method is invoked for the attribute.
       The 'value' and 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' fields are cleared.
 =0 Then the value is always cached and always valid.
       The 'value' field is returned. If there is no'value' field
       then the getter method is invoked for the attribute.
       The 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' field and `value' fields are set
       to the attribute's value and the current time stamp.
 >0 Represents the number of seconds that the 'value'
       field is valid.
       The 'value' field is no longer valid when
       'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' + 'currencyTimeLimit' > Now.
   
When 'value' is valid, 'value' is returned.
When 'value' is no longer valid then the getter
            method is invoked for the attribute.
            The 'lastUpdatedTimeStamp' field and `value' fields
            are updated.


Note: because of inconsistencies in previous versions of
 this specification, it is recommended not to use negative or zero
 values for currencyTimeLimit.  To indicate that a
 cached value is never valid, omit the
 currencyTimeLimit field.  To indicate that it is
 always valid, use a very large number for this field.
If the 'getMethod' field contains the name of a valid
 operation descriptor, then the method described by the
 operation descriptor is executed.  The response from the
 method is returned as the value of the attribute.  If the
 operation fails or the returned value is not compatible with
 the declared type of the attribute, an exception will be thrown.
If no 'getMethod' field is defined then the default value of the
 attribute is returned. If the returned value is not compatible with
 the declared type of the attribute, an exception will be thrown.
The declared type of the attribute is the String returned by
 MBeanAttributeInfo.getType().  A value is compatible
 with this type if one of the following is true:
 
the value is null;
the declared name is a primitive type name (such as "int")
     and the value is an instance of the corresponding wrapper
     type (such as java.lang.Integer);
the name of the value's class is identical to the declared name;
the declared name can be loaded by the value's class loader and
     produces a class to which the value can be assigned.

In this implementation, in every case where the getMethod needs to
 be called, because the method is invoked through the standard "invoke"
 method and thus needs operationInfo, an operation must be specified
 for that getMethod so that the invocation works correctly.

Specified by:
getAttribute in interface DynamicMBean
Parameters:
attrName - A String specifying the name of the
 attribute to be retrieved. It must match the name of a
 ModelMBeanAttributeInfo.
Returns:
The value of the retrieved attribute from the
 descriptor 'value' field or from the invocation of the
 operation in the 'getMethod' field of the descriptor.
Throws:
AttributeNotFoundException - The specified attribute is
    not accessible in the MBean.
    The following cases may result in an AttributeNotFoundException:
    
 No ModelMBeanInfo was found for the Model MBean.
 No ModelMBeanAttributeInfo was found for the specified
           attribute name.
 The ModelMBeanAttributeInfo isReadable method returns
           'false'.

MBeanException - Wraps one of the following Exceptions:
    
 InvalidAttributeValueException: A wrong value type
           was received from the attribute's getter method or
           no 'getMethod' field defined in the descriptor for
           the attribute and no default value exists.
 ServiceNotFoundException: No
           ModelMBeanOperationInfo defined for the attribute's
           getter method or no descriptor associated with the
           ModelMBeanOperationInfo or the managed resource is
           null.
 InvalidTargetObjectTypeException The 'targetType'
           field value is not 'objectReference'.
 An Exception thrown by the managed object's getter.

ReflectionException - Wraps an Exception
    thrown while trying to invoke the getter.
RuntimeOperationsException - Wraps an
    IllegalArgumentException: The attribute name in
    parameter is null.
