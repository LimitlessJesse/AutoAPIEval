Here is the full description of the method: 


setDefault
public static void setDefault(Authenticator a)
Sets the authenticator that will be used by the networking code
 when a proxy or an HTTP server asks for authentication.
 
 First, if there is a security manager, its checkPermission
 method is called with a
 NetPermission("setDefaultAuthenticator") permission.
 This may result in a java.lang.SecurityException.

Parameters:
a - The authenticator to be set. If a is null then
                  any previously set authenticator is removed.
Throws:
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and its
        checkPermission method doesn't allow
        setting the default authenticator.

In this code snippet, we are setting a default authenticator that will be used by the networking code when a proxy or an HTTP server asks for authentication. The `getPasswordAuthentication()` method is overridden to provide the username and password.

Please replace "username" and "password" with your actual username and password.

Note: The `setDefault(Authenticator a)` method is static, so it can be called directly from the `Authenticator` class. The `getPasswordAuthentication()` method is protected, so it can only be accessed by subclasses of `Authenticator`.

        // Now you can use any network related code that needs authentication
    }

In this example, we are setting a default authenticator that always returns a `PasswordAuthentication` object with the username and password "username" and "password".

Please replace "username" and "password" with your actual username and password.

Remember that this is a simple example and in a real-world application, you would not hard-code the username and password. Instead, you would get them from a secure source, such as a user input or a configuration file.

In this example, we are creating a new URL object and opening a connection to it. Then we create a new ContentHandler that overrides the `getContent` method. Inside this method, we are reading the content from the URL connection's input stream and returning it. Finally, we are calling the `getContent` method on the ContentHandler and printing the returned object.

Please note that this is a very basic example and may not work for all URLs. The `getContent` method is used to read the content of a URL and it may return different types of objects depending on the content type of the URL.

Here is a simple example of how to use the `getAddress()` method from `java.net.DatagramPacket`:

```java
import java.net.DatagramPacket;
import java.net.InetAddress;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Create a DatagramPacket
        byte[] buf = new byte[1024];
        DatagramPacket packet = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length);

        // Get the IP address of the machine to which this datagram is being sent
        InetAddress address = packet.getAddress();
        System.out.println("IP address: " + address.getHostAddress());
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a `DatagramPacket` and then use the `getAddress()` method to get the IP address of the machine to which this datagram is being sent. The `getHostAddress()` method is then used to get the string representation of the IP address.

Please note that this code will not work if you run it on your local machine because it will not have any network connection. You need to run this code on a machine that is connected to the network.

send
public void send(DatagramPacket p)
          throws IOException
Sends a datagram packet from this socket. The
 DatagramPacket includes information indicating the
 data to be sent, its length, the IP address of the remote host,
 and the port number on the remote host.

 If there is a security manager, and the socket is not currently
 connected to a remote address, this method first performs some
 security checks. First, if p.getAddress().isMulticastAddress()
 is true, this method calls the
 security manager's checkMulticast method
 with p.getAddress() as its argument.
 If the evaluation of that expression is false,
 this method instead calls the security manager's
 checkConnect method with arguments
 p.getAddress().getHostAddress() and
 p.getPort(). Each call to a security manager method
 could result in a SecurityException if the operation is not allowed.

Parameters:
p - the DatagramPacket to be sent.
Throws:
IOException - if an I/O error occurs.
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and its
             checkMulticast or checkConnect
             method doesn't allow the send.
PortUnreachableException - may be thrown if the socket is connected
             to a currently unreachable destination. Note, there is no
             guarantee that the exception will be thrown.
IllegalBlockingModeException - if this socket has an associated channel,

IllegalArgumentException - if the socket is connected,
             and connected address and packet address differ.

This code creates a server socket that listens on port 9876. It then waits for a datagram packet to be received. The received data is converted to a string, and the IP address and port of the sender are obtained. The string is then converted to uppercase, and the resulting bytes are sent back to the sender. Finally, the server socket is closed.

Please note that this is a simple example and does not handle exceptions or edge cases. In a real-world application, you would need to add error handling and possibly use a different approach to handle the received data.

In this code snippet, we create a new `DatagramSocket` and then we create an `InetAddress` for the localhost and a port number. We then create a `SocketAddress` using the `InetAddress` and port number. Finally, we call the `connect` method on the `DatagramSocket` with the `SocketAddress` as the argument.

Please note that the `connect` method is not used for datagram sockets, it is used for stream sockets (`java.net.Socket`). For datagram sockets, you typically send and receive datagram packets directly using the `send` and `receive` methods.

Here is the full description of the method: 


connect
public void connect(InetAddress address,
                    int port)
Connects the socket to a remote address for this socket. When a
 socket is connected to a remote address, packets may only be
 sent to or received from that address. By default a datagram
 socket is not connected.

 If the remote destination to which the socket is connected does not
 exist, or is otherwise unreachable, and if an ICMP destination unreachable
 packet has been received for that address, then a subsequent call to
 send or receive may throw a PortUnreachableException. Note, there is no
 guarantee that the exception will be thrown.

  If a security manager has been installed then it is invoked to check
 access to the remote address. Specifically, if the given address
 is a multicast address,
 the security manager's checkMulticast method is invoked with the given address.
 Otherwise, the security manager's checkConnect
 and checkAccept methods
 are invoked, with the given address and port, to
 verify that datagrams are permitted to be sent and received
 respectively.

  When a socket is connected, receive and
 send will not perform any security checks
 on incoming and outgoing packets, other than matching the packet's
 and the socket's address and port. On a send operation, if the
 packet's address is set and the packet's address and the socket's
 address do not match, an IllegalArgumentException will be
 thrown. A socket connected to a multicast address may only be used
 to send packets.

Parameters:
address - the remote address for the socket
port - the remote port for the socket.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the address is null, or the port is out of range.
SecurityException - if a security manager has been installed and it does
         not permit access to the given remote address

Here is the full description of the method: 


setTrafficClass
public void setTrafficClass(int tc)
                     throws SocketException
Sets traffic class or type-of-service octet in the IP
 datagram header for datagrams sent from this DatagramSocket.
 As the underlying network implementation may ignore this
 value applications should consider it a hint.

  The tc must be in the range 0 <= tc <=
 255 or an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
 Notes:
 For Internet Protocol v4 the value consists of an
 integer, the least significant 8 bits of which
 represent the value of the TOS octet in IP packets sent by
 the socket.
 RFC 1349 defines the TOS values as follows:

 
IPTOS_LOWCOST (0x02)
IPTOS_RELIABILITY (0x04)
IPTOS_THROUGHPUT (0x08)
IPTOS_LOWDELAY (0x10)

 The last low order bit is always ignored as this
 corresponds to the MBZ (must be zero) bit.
 
 Setting bits in the precedence field may result in a
 SocketException indicating that the operation is not
 permitted.
 
 for Internet Protocol v6 tc is the value that
 would be placed into the sin6_flowinfo field of the IP header.

Parameters:
tc - an int value for the bitset.
Throws:
SocketException - if there is an error setting the
 traffic class or type-of-service

1.4

Here is a complete code snippet of the `setPath` method from `java.net.HttpCookie`:

```java
import java.net.HttpCookie;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        cookie.setPath("/catalog");

In this code snippet, we first create a new `HttpCookie` object with a name and a value. Then we set the path of the cookie to "/catalog". Finally, we print the path of the cookie to the console.

Please note that the `setPath` method sets the path of the cookie, but it does not actually send the cookie to the client. You would need to use a `CookieHandler` or `CookieManager` to send the cookie to the client.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `toASCII` method from `java.net.IDN`:

```java
import java.net.IDN;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "example.com";
        String output = IDN.toASCII(input);
        System.out.println(output);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are importing the `java.net.IDN` package and then calling the `toASCII` method on a string. The `toASCII` method translates a string from Unicode to ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE), as defined by the ToASCII operation of RFC 3490.

Please replace "example.com" with the domain name you want to convert to ACE.

Note: This method will throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if the input string doesn't conform to RFC 3490 specification.

toUnicode
public static String toUnicode(String input,

Translates a string from ASCII Compatible Encoding (ACE) to Unicode,
 as defined by the ToUnicode operation of RFC 3490.

 ToUnicode never fails. In case of any error, the input string is returned unmodified.

  A label is an individual part of a domain name. The original ToUnicode operation,
 as defined in RFC 3490, only operates on a single label. This method can handle
 both label and entire domain name, by assuming that labels in a domain name are
 always separated by dots. The following characters are recognized as dots:
 \u002E (full stop), \u3002 (ideographic full stop), \uFF0E (fullwidth full stop),
 and \uFF61 (halfwidth ideographic full stop).

Parameters:
input - the string to be processed
flag - process flag; can be 0 or any logical OR of possible flags
Returns:
the translated String

getByName
public static InetAddress getByName(String host)
                             throws UnknownHostException
Determines the IP address of a host, given the host's name.

  The host name can either be a machine name, such as
 "java.sun.com", or a textual representation of its
 IP address. If a literal IP address is supplied, only the
 validity of the address format is checked.

  For host specified in literal IPv6 address,
 either the form defined in RFC 2732 or the literal IPv6 address
 format defined in RFC 2373 is accepted. IPv6 scoped addresses are also
 supported. See here for a description of IPv6
 scoped addresses.

  If the host is null then an InetAddress
 representing an address of the loopback interface is returned.
 See RFC 3330
 section 2 and RFC 2373
 section 2.5.3. 

Parameters:
host - the specified host, or null.
Returns:

Throws:
UnknownHostException - if no IP address for the
               host could be found, or if a scope_id was specified

Here is a simple code snippet that uses the `getHostAddress()` method from the `java.net.InetAddress` class:

```java
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.UnknownHostException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InetAddress inetAddress = InetAddress.getByName("www.google.com");
            String ipAddress = inetAddress.getHostAddress();
            System.out.println("IP Address: " + ipAddress);
        } catch (UnknownHostException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are getting the IP address of a host by its name. The `getByName()` method is used to get the InetAddress object of the host. The `getHostAddress()` method is then used to get the IP address of the host.

Please note that the host name "www.google.com" is just an example. You can replace it with any valid host name.

Also, the `UnknownHostException` is a checked exception that is thrown when the InetAddress.getByName() method is unable to resolve the host name into an IP address. This exception is caught and handled in the code snippet.

Here is the full description of the method: 


isReachable
public boolean isReachable(int timeout)
                    throws IOException
Test whether that address is reachable. Best effort is made by the
 implementation to try to reach the host, but firewalls and server
 configuration may block requests resulting in a unreachable status
 while some specific ports may be accessible.
 A typical implementation will use ICMP ECHO REQUESTs if the
 privilege can be obtained, otherwise it will try to establish
 a TCP connection on port 7 (Echo) of the destination host.
 
 The timeout value, in milliseconds, indicates the maximum amount of time
 the try should take. If the operation times out before getting an
 answer, the host is deemed unreachable. A negative value will result
 in an IllegalArgumentException being thrown.

Parameters:
timeout - the time, in milliseconds, before the call aborts
Returns:
a boolean indicating if the address is reachable.
Throws:
IOException - if a network error occurs
IllegalArgumentException - if timeout is negative.
Since:
1.5

```

In this code snippet, we are using `InetAddress.getByName("www.google.com")` to get the InetAddress of the host "www.google.com". Then we are calling the `isReachable(5000)` method on this InetAddress object. The `isReachable(5000)` method will return `true` if the host is reachable within 5 seconds, and `false` otherwise.

Please replace "www.google.com" with the host you want to check.

Also, please note that the `isReachable` method can throw `UnknownHostException` and `IOException`. So, we are wrapping the code inside a try-catch block to handle these exceptions.

I want to learn how to use void setTimeToLive(int ttl) from java.net.MulticastSocket
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

Here is a complete code snippet of the `setTimeToLive(int ttl)` method from `java.net.MulticastSocket`:

```java
import java.net.DatagramSocket;
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.net.MulticastSocket;
import java.net.SocketException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName("224.0.0.1");
            MulticastSocket socket = new MulticastSocket(4446);
            socket.joinGroup(group);
            socket.setTimeToLive(1);
            socket.leaveGroup(group);
            socket.close();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a `MulticastSocket` and set the time-to-live (TTL) to 1. The TTL is set to 1 to limit the scope of the multicast packets. After setting the TTL, we join the multicast group and then leave the group. Finally, we close the socket.

Please note that you need to replace "224.0.0.1" and 4446 with your actual multicast group and port. Also, you need to handle the `SocketException` and other possible exceptions according to your application's requirements.

import java.net.ServerSocket;
import java.net.InetAddress;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            ServerSocket serverSocket = new ServerSocket(0);
            InetAddress inetAddress = serverSocket.getInetAddress();
            System.out.println("Local Address: " + inetAddress);
            serverSocket.close();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new `ServerSocket` object with a port number of 0, which means the system will automatically assign a port number. We then call the `getInetAddress()` method on the `ServerSocket` object to get the local address of the server socket. Finally, we close the `ServerSocket` to release the resources.

Please note that the `getInetAddress()` method can throw an `IOException` if an I/O error occurs when creating the server socket. We handle this exception by wrapping the code in a try-catch block.

setReceiveBufferSize
public void setReceiveBufferSize(int size)
                          throws SocketException
Sets a default proposed value for the
 SO_RCVBUF option for sockets
 accepted from this ServerSocket. The value actually set
 in the accepted socket must be determined by calling
 Socket.getReceiveBufferSize() after the socket
 is returned by accept().
 
 The value of SO_RCVBUF is used both to
 set the size of the internal socket receive buffer, and to set the size
 of the TCP receive window that is advertized to the remote peer.
 
 It is possible to change the value subsequently, by calling
 Socket.setReceiveBufferSize(int). However, if the application
 wishes to allow a receive window larger than 64K bytes, as defined by RFC1323
 then the proposed value must be set in the ServerSocket before
 it is bound to a local address. This implies, that the ServerSocket must be
 created with the no-argument constructor, then setReceiveBufferSize() must
 be called and lastly the ServerSocket is bound to an address by calling bind().
 
 Failure to do this will not cause an error, and the buffer size may be set to the
 requested value but the TCP receive window in sockets accepted from
 this ServerSocket will be no larger than 64K bytes.

Parameters:
size - the size to which to set the receive buffer
 size. This value must be greater than 0.
Throws:
SocketException - if there is an error
 in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.
IllegalArgumentException - if the
 value is 0 or is negative.

setReuseAddress
public void setReuseAddress(boolean on)
                     throws SocketException
Enable/disable the SO_REUSEADDR
 socket option.
 
 When a TCP connection is closed the connection may remain
 in a timeout state for a period of time after the connection
 is closed (typically known as the TIME_WAIT state
 or 2MSL wait state).
 For applications using a well known socket address or port
 it may not be possible to bind a socket to the required
 SocketAddress if there is a connection in the
 timeout state involving the socket address or port.
 
 Enabling SO_REUSEADDR prior to
 binding the socket using bind(SocketAddress) allows the socket
 to be bound even though a previous connection is in a timeout state.
 
 When a ServerSocket is created the initial setting
 of SO_REUSEADDR is not defined.
 Applications can use getReuseAddress() to determine the initial
 setting of SO_REUSEADDR.
 
 The behaviour when SO_REUSEADDR is
 enabled or disabled after a socket is bound (See isBound())
 is not defined.

Parameters:
on - whether to enable or disable the socket option

 Under abnormal conditions the underlying connection may be
 broken by the remote host or the network software (for example
 a connection reset in the case of TCP connections). When a
 broken connection is detected by the network software the
 following applies to the returned input stream :-

 
The network software may discard bytes that are buffered

   software can be read using read.

   If there are no bytes buffered on the socket, or all

```

In this code snippet, we create a new socket connection to localhost on port 8080. We then get the output stream from the socket and write a string to it. After that, we close the output stream and the socket.

Please replace "localhost" and 8080 with your actual host and port.

Also, remember to handle exceptions properly in a real-world application. In this example, we just print the stack trace of the exception and continue. In a production environment, you would want to handle exceptions in a more graceful way.

Here is the description of the class: This class implements client sockets (also called just "sockets").
Here is the full description of the method: 


close
public void close()
           throws IOException
Closes this socket.
 
 Any thread currently blocked in an I/O operation upon this socket
 will throw a SocketException.
 
 Once a socket has been closed, it is not available for further networking
 use (i.e. can't be reconnected or rebound). A new socket needs to be
 created.

  Closing this socket will also close the socket's
 InputStream and
 OutputStream.

  If this socket has an associated channel then the channel is closed
 as well.

Specified by:
close in interface Closeable
Specified by:
close in interface AutoCloseable
Throws:
IOException - if an I/O error occurs when closing this socket.

In this code, we create a new socket to connect to `www.example.com` on port 80. After we're done using the socket, we call the `close()` method to close the socket. If an `IOException` occurs during the closing process, it will be caught and printed to the console.

}
```

In this code, we create a new socket that connects to localhost on port 8080. We then call the `isConnected()` method on the socket and print the result. After closing the socket, we call `isConnected()` again and print the result.

Please note that the `isConnected()` method returns true if the socket was successfully connected to a server, and false if the socket is closed.

isBound
public boolean isBound()
Returns the binding state of the socket.
 
 Note: Closing a socket doesn't clear its binding state, which means
 this method will return true for a closed socket
 (see isClosed()) if it was successfuly bound prior
 to being closed.

Returns:
true if the socket was successfuly bound to an address

Here is a complete code snippet of the `isBound()` method from `java.net.Socket`:

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

}
```

In this code, we create a `ServerSocket` on port 8080 and a `Socket` to connect to the server on the same port. We then call the `isBound()` method on the `Socket` and print the result.

The `isBound()` method returns `true` if the socket was successfully bound to an address, and `false` otherwise. In this case, the socket is successfully bound to an address because we are using a `Socket` to connect to a `ServerSocket` on the same port.

Note: The `isBound()` method does not return the binding state of the socket. It returns the state of the socket after the last operation. If the socket was not bound before the last operation, it will return `false`.

public void setReuseAddress(boolean on)
                     throws SocketException
Enable/disable the SO_REUSEADDR
 socket option.
 
 When a TCP connection is closed the connection may remain
 in a timeout state for a period of time after the connection
 is closed (typically known as the TIME_WAIT state
 or 2MSL wait state).
 For applications using a well known socket address or port
 it may not be possible to bind a socket to the required
 SocketAddress if there is a connection in the
 timeout state involving the socket address or port.
 
 Enabling SO_REUSEADDR
 prior to binding the socket using bind(SocketAddress) allows
 the socket to be bound even though a previous connection is in a timeout
 state.
 
 When a Socket is created the initial setting
 of SO_REUSEADDR is disabled.
 
 The behaviour when SO_REUSEADDR is
 enabled or disabled after a socket is bound (See isBound())
 is not defined.

Parameters:
on - whether to enable or disable the socket option
Throws:
SocketException - if an error occurs enabling or
            disabling the SO_REUSEADDR

In this code snippet, we create a new socket to connect to Google's web server on port 80. We then call the `getKeepAlive()` method on the socket to check if SO_KEEPALIVE is enabled. The result is printed to the console. Finally, we close the socket.

Please note that the `getKeepAlive()` method can throw a `SocketException` if there is an error in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error. We handle this exception by catching it and printing the stack trace.

setOOBInline
public void setOOBInline(boolean on)
                  throws SocketException
Enable/disable SO_OOBINLINE
 (receipt of TCP urgent data)

 By default, this option is disabled and TCP urgent data received on a
 socket is silently discarded. If the user wishes to receive urgent data, then
 this option must be enabled. When enabled, urgent data is received
 inline with normal data.
 
 Note, only limited support is provided for handling incoming urgent
 data. In particular, no notification of incoming urgent data is provided
 and there is no capability to distinguish between normal data and urgent
 data unless provided by a higher level protocol.

Parameters:
on - true to enable
           SO_OOBINLINE,
           false to disable.
Throws:
SocketException - if there is an error
 in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.

setReceiveBufferSize
public void setReceiveBufferSize(int size)
                          throws SocketException
Sets the SO_RCVBUF option to the
 specified value for this Socket. The
 SO_RCVBUF option is
 used by the platform's networking code as a hint for the size to set
 the underlying network I/O buffers.

 Increasing the receive buffer size can increase the performance of
 network I/O for high-volume connection, while decreasing it can
 help reduce the backlog of incoming data.

 Because SO_RCVBUF is a hint,
 applications that want to verify what size the buffers were set to
 should call getReceiveBufferSize().

 The value of SO_RCVBUF is also used
 to set the TCP receive window that is advertized to the remote peer.
 Generally, the window size can be modified at any time when a socket is
 connected. However, if a receive window larger than 64K is required then
 this must be requested before the socket is connected to the
 remote peer. There are two cases to be aware of:
 
For sockets accepted from a ServerSocket, this must be done by calling
 ServerSocket.setReceiveBufferSize(int) before the ServerSocket
 is bound to a local address.
For client sockets, setReceiveBufferSize() must be called before
 connecting the socket to its remote peer.

Parameters:
size - the size to which to set the receive buffer
 size. This value must be greater than 0.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the value is 0 or is
 negative.
SocketException - if there is an error

Sets performance preferences for this socket.

  Sockets use the TCP/IP protocol by default.  Some implementations
 may offer alternative protocols which have different performance
 characteristics than TCP/IP.  This method allows the application to
 express its own preferences as to how these tradeoffs should be made
 when the implementation chooses from the available protocols.

  Performance preferences are described by three integers
 whose values indicate the relative importance of short connection time,
 low latency, and high bandwidth.  The absolute values of the integers
 are irrelevant; in order to choose a protocol the values are simply
 compared, with larger values indicating stronger preferences. Negative
 values represent a lower priority than positive values. If the
 application prefers short connection time over both low latency and high
 bandwidth, for example, then it could invoke this method with the values
 (1, 0, 0).  If the application prefers high bandwidth above low
 latency, and low latency above short connection time, then it could
 invoke this method with the values (0, 1, 2).

  Invoking this method after this socket has been connected
 will have no effect.

Parameters:
connectionTime - An int expressing the relative importance of a short
         connection time
latency - An int expressing the relative importance of low

                    throws IOException
Disables the output stream for this socket.
 For a TCP socket, any previously written data will be sent
 followed by TCP's normal connection termination sequence.

 If you write to a socket output stream after invoking
 shutdownOutput() on the socket, the stream will throw
 an IOException.

Throws:
IOException - if an I/O error occurs when shutting down this
 socket.

        try {

In this code snippet, we create a new socket connected to localhost on port 8080. We then call `shutdownOutput()` on the socket, which disables the output stream for this socket. After that, we try to write to the socket's output stream. Since we have disabled the output stream, this will throw an `IOException`.

setTrafficClass
public void setTrafficClass(int tc)
                     throws SocketException
Sets traffic class or type-of-service octet in the IP
 header for packets sent from this Socket.
 As the underlying network implementation may ignore this
 value applications should consider it a hint.

  The tc must be in the range 0 <= tc <=
 255 or an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
 Notes:
 For Internet Protocol v4 the value consists of an
 integer, the least significant 8 bits of which
 represent the value of the TOS octet in IP packets sent by
 the socket.
 RFC 1349 defines the TOS values as follows:

 
IPTOS_LOWCOST (0x02)
IPTOS_RELIABILITY (0x04)
IPTOS_THROUGHPUT (0x08)
IPTOS_LOWDELAY (0x10)

 The last low order bit is always ignored as this
 corresponds to the MBZ (must be zero) bit.
 
 Setting bits in the precedence field may result in a
 SocketException indicating that the operation is not
 permitted.
 
 As RFC 1122 section 4.2.4.2 indicates, a compliant TCP
 implementation should, but is not required to, let application
 change the TOS field during the lifetime of a connection.
 So whether the type-of-service field can be changed after the
 TCP connection has been established depends on the implementation
 in the underlying platform. Applications should not assume that
 they can change the TOS field after the connection.
 
 For Internet Protocol v6 tc is the value that
 would be placed into the sin6_flowinfo field of the IP header.

Parameters:
tc - an int value for the bitset.
Throws:
SocketException - if there is an error setting the
 traffic class or type-of-service

setReceiveBufferSize
public void setReceiveBufferSize(int size)
                          throws SocketException
Sets the SO_RCVBUF option to the
 specified value for this Socket. The
 SO_RCVBUF option is
 used by the platform's networking code as a hint for the size to set
 the underlying network I/O buffers.

 Increasing the receive buffer size can increase the performance of
 network I/O for high-volume connection, while decreasing it can
 help reduce the backlog of incoming data.

 Because SO_RCVBUF is a hint,
 applications that want to verify what size the buffers were set to
 should call getReceiveBufferSize().

 The value of SO_RCVBUF is also used
 to set the TCP receive window that is advertized to the remote peer.
 Generally, the window size can be modified at any time when a socket is
 connected. However, if a receive window larger than 64K is required then
 this must be requested before the socket is connected to the
 remote peer. There are two cases to be aware of:
 
For sockets accepted from a ServerSocket, this must be done by calling
 ServerSocket.setReceiveBufferSize(int) before the ServerSocket
 is bound to a local address.
For client sockets, setReceiveBufferSize() must be called before
 connecting the socket to its remote peer.

Parameters:
size - the size to which to set the receive buffer
 size. This value must be greater than 0.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the value is 0 or is
 negative.
SocketException - if there is an error

Sets performance preferences for this socket.

  Sockets use the TCP/IP protocol by default.  Some implementations
 may offer alternative protocols which have different performance
 characteristics than TCP/IP.  This method allows the application to
 express its own preferences as to how these tradeoffs should be made
 when the implementation chooses from the available protocols.

  Performance preferences are described by three integers
 whose values indicate the relative importance of short connection time,
 low latency, and high bandwidth.  The absolute values of the integers
 are irrelevant; in order to choose a protocol the values are simply
 compared, with larger values indicating stronger preferences. Negative
 values represent a lower priority than positive values. If the
 application prefers short connection time over both low latency and high
 bandwidth, for example, then it could invoke this method with the values
 (1, 0, 0).  If the application prefers high bandwidth above low
 latency, and low latency above short connection time, then it could
 invoke this method with the values (0, 1, 2).

  Invoking this method after this socket has been connected
 will have no effect.

Parameters:
connectionTime - An int expressing the relative importance of a short
         connection time
latency - An int expressing the relative importance of low

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

Here is a complete code snippet of the `shutdownInput()` method from `java.net.Socket`:

```java
import java.net.Socket;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Socket socket = new Socket("localhost", 8080);
            socket.shutdownInput();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new socket and call the `shutdownInput()` method on it. This method is used to close the input stream of the socket. After calling this method, the `isInputShutdown()` method will return `true`, and the `read()` method will return `-1`.

Please replace `"localhost"` and `8080` with your actual host and port.

Also, remember to handle the `IOException` that may be thrown by the `shutdownInput()` method. In this example, we catch the exception and print the stack trace.

Disables the output stream for this socket.
 For a TCP socket, any previously written data will be sent
 followed by TCP's normal connection termination sequence.

 If you write to a socket output stream after invoking
 shutdownOutput() on the socket, the stream will throw
 an IOException.

Throws:
IOException - if an I/O error occurs when shutting down this
 socket.

setTrafficClass
public void setTrafficClass(int tc)
                     throws SocketException
Sets traffic class or type-of-service octet in the IP
 header for packets sent from this Socket.
 As the underlying network implementation may ignore this
 value applications should consider it a hint.

  The tc must be in the range 0 <= tc <=
 255 or an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
 Notes:
 For Internet Protocol v4 the value consists of an
 integer, the least significant 8 bits of which
 represent the value of the TOS octet in IP packets sent by
 the socket.
 RFC 1349 defines the TOS values as follows:

 
IPTOS_LOWCOST (0x02)
IPTOS_RELIABILITY (0x04)
IPTOS_THROUGHPUT (0x08)
IPTOS_LOWDELAY (0x10)

 The last low order bit is always ignored as this
 corresponds to the MBZ (must be zero) bit.
 
 Setting bits in the precedence field may result in a
 SocketException indicating that the operation is not
 permitted.
 
 As RFC 1122 section 4.2.4.2 indicates, a compliant TCP
 implementation should, but is not required to, let application
 change the TOS field during the lifetime of a connection.
 So whether the type-of-service field can be changed after the
 TCP connection has been established depends on the implementation
 in the underlying platform. Applications should not assume that
 they can change the TOS field after the connection.
 
 For Internet Protocol v6 tc is the value that
 would be placed into the sin6_flowinfo field of the IP header.

Parameters:
tc - an int value for the bitset.
Throws:
SocketException - if there is an error setting the
 traffic class or type-of-service

setReceiveBufferSize
public void setReceiveBufferSize(int size)
                          throws SocketException
Sets the SO_RCVBUF option to the
 specified value for this Socket. The
 SO_RCVBUF option is
 used by the platform's networking code as a hint for the size to set
 the underlying network I/O buffers.

 Increasing the receive buffer size can increase the performance of
 network I/O for high-volume connection, while decreasing it can
 help reduce the backlog of incoming data.

 Because SO_RCVBUF is a hint,
 applications that want to verify what size the buffers were set to
 should call getReceiveBufferSize().

 The value of SO_RCVBUF is also used
 to set the TCP receive window that is advertized to the remote peer.
 Generally, the window size can be modified at any time when a socket is
 connected. However, if a receive window larger than 64K is required then
 this must be requested before the socket is connected to the
 remote peer. There are two cases to be aware of:
 
For sockets accepted from a ServerSocket, this must be done by calling
 ServerSocket.setReceiveBufferSize(int) before the ServerSocket
 is bound to a local address.
For client sockets, setReceiveBufferSize() must be called before
 connecting the socket to its remote peer.

Parameters:
size - the size to which to set the receive buffer
 size. This value must be greater than 0.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the value is 0 or is
 negative.
SocketException - if there is an error
 in the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.

Sets performance preferences for this socket.

  Sockets use the TCP/IP protocol by default.  Some implementations
 may offer alternative protocols which have different performance
 characteristics than TCP/IP.  This method allows the application to
 express its own preferences as to how these tradeoffs should be made
 when the implementation chooses from the available protocols.

  Performance preferences are described by three integers
 whose values indicate the relative importance of short connection time,
 low latency, and high bandwidth.  The absolute values of the integers
 are irrelevant; in order to choose a protocol the values are simply
 compared, with larger values indicating stronger preferences. Negative
 values represent a lower priority than positive values. If the
 application prefers short connection time over both low latency and high
 bandwidth, for example, then it could invoke this method with the values
 (1, 0, 0).  If the application prefers high bandwidth above low
 latency, and low latency above short connection time, then it could
 invoke this method with the values (0, 1, 2).

  Invoking this method after this socket has been connected
 will have no effect.

Parameters:
connectionTime - An int expressing the relative importance of a short
         connection time
latency - An int expressing the relative importance of low

Here is a complete code snippet of the `setPerformancePreferences` method from `java.net.Socket`:

```java
import java.net.Socket;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Socket socket = new Socket("www.example.com", 80);
            socket.setPerformancePreferences(1, 0, 0);

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new socket and set the performance preferences to prefer short connection time over low latency and high bandwidth. The `setPerformancePreferences` method is then called on the socket. Finally, the socket is closed.

Please replace `"www.example.com"` and `80` with your own host and port.

Note: The `setPerformancePreferences` method is not commonly used in practice because it is not guaranteed to have any effect. It is more of a hint to the underlying networking stack, and the actual behavior may depend on the specific implementation of the socket.

setTrafficClass
public void setTrafficClass(int tc)
                     throws SocketException
Sets traffic class or type-of-service octet in the IP
 header for packets sent from this Socket.
 As the underlying network implementation may ignore this
 value applications should consider it a hint.

  The tc must be in the range 0 <= tc <=
 255 or an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
 Notes:
 For Internet Protocol v4 the value consists of an
 integer, the least significant 8 bits of which
 represent the value of the TOS octet in IP packets sent by
 the socket.
 RFC 1349 defines the TOS values as follows:

 
IPTOS_LOWCOST (0x02)
IPTOS_RELIABILITY (0x04)
IPTOS_THROUGHPUT (0x08)
IPTOS_LOWDELAY (0x10)

 The last low order bit is always ignored as this
 corresponds to the MBZ (must be zero) bit.
 
 Setting bits in the precedence field may result in a
 SocketException indicating that the operation is not
 permitted.
 
 As RFC 1122 section 4.2.4.2 indicates, a compliant TCP
 implementation should, but is not required to, let application
 change the TOS field during the lifetime of a connection.
 So whether the type-of-service field can be changed after the
 TCP connection has been established depends on the implementation
 in the underlying platform. Applications should not assume that
 they can change the TOS field after the connection.
 
 For Internet Protocol v6 tc is the value that
 would be placed into the sin6_flowinfo field of the IP header.

Parameters:
tc - an int value for the bitset.
Throws:
SocketException - if there is an error setting the
 traffic class or type-of-service

setReceiveBufferSize
public void setReceiveBufferSize(int size)
                          throws SocketException
Sets the SO_RCVBUF option to the
 specified value for this Socket. The
 SO_RCVBUF option is
 used by the platform's networking code as a hint for the size to set
 the underlying network I/O buffers.

 Increasing the receive buffer size can increase the performance of
 network I/O for high-volume connection, while decreasing it can
 help reduce the backlog of incoming data.

 Because SO_RCVBUF is a hint,
 applications that want to verify what size the buffers were set to
 should call getReceiveBufferSize().

 The value of SO_RCVBUF is also used
 to set the TCP receive window that is advertized to the remote peer.
 Generally, the window size can be modified at any time when a socket is
 connected. However, if a receive window larger than 64K is required then
 this must be requested before the socket is connected to the
 remote peer. There are two cases to be aware of:
 
For sockets accepted from a ServerSocket, this must be done by calling
 ServerSocket.setReceiveBufferSize(int) before the ServerSocket
 is bound to a local address.
For client sockets, setReceiveBufferSize() must be called before
 connecting the socket to its remote peer.

Parameters:
size - the size to which to set the receive buffer
 size. This value must be greater than 0.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the value is 0 or is
 negative.
SocketException - if there is an error

                                      int bandwidth)
Sets performance preferences for this socket.

  Sockets use the TCP/IP protocol by default.  Some implementations
 may offer alternative protocols which have different performance
 characteristics than TCP/IP.  This method allows the application to
 express its own preferences as to how these tradeoffs should be made
 when the implementation chooses from the available protocols.

  Performance preferences are described by three integers
 whose values indicate the relative importance of short connection time,
 low latency, and high bandwidth.  The absolute values of the integers
 are irrelevant; in order to choose a protocol the values are simply
 compared, with larger values indicating stronger preferences. Negative
 values represent a lower priority than positive values. If the
 application prefers short connection time over both low latency and high
 bandwidth, for example, then it could invoke this method with the values
 (1, 0, 0).  If the application prefers high bandwidth above low
 latency, and low latency above short connection time, then it could
 invoke this method with the values (0, 1, 2).

  Invoking this method after this socket has been connected
 will have no effect.

Parameters:
connectionTime - An int expressing the relative importance of a short
         connection time
latency - An int expressing the relative importance of low
         latency
bandwidth - An int expressing the relative importance of high
         bandwidth

In this code snippet, we create a new socket and set the performance preferences to prefer short connection time over low latency and high bandwidth. The `setPerformancePreferences` method is then called on the socket. Finally, the socket is closed.

Please replace `"www.example.com"` and `80` with your own host and port.

Note: The `setPerformancePreferences` method is not commonly used in practice because it is not guaranteed to have any effect. It is more of a hint to the underlying networking stack, and the actual behavior may depend on the specific implementation of the socket.

setTrafficClass
public void setTrafficClass(int tc)
                     throws SocketException
Sets traffic class or type-of-service octet in the IP
 header for packets sent from this Socket.
 As the underlying network implementation may ignore this
 value applications should consider it a hint.

  The tc must be in the range 0 <= tc <=
 255 or an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
 Notes:
 For Internet Protocol v4 the value consists of an
 integer, the least significant 8 bits of which
 represent the value of the TOS octet in IP packets sent by
 the socket.
 RFC 1349 defines the TOS values as follows:

 
IPTOS_LOWCOST (0x02)
IPTOS_RELIABILITY (0x04)
IPTOS_THROUGHPUT (0x08)
IPTOS_LOWDELAY (0x10)

 The last low order bit is always ignored as this
 corresponds to the MBZ (must be zero) bit.
 
 Setting bits in the precedence field may result in a
 SocketException indicating that the operation is not
 permitted.
 
 As RFC 1122 section 4.2.4.2 indicates, a compliant TCP
 implementation should, but is not required to, let application
 change the TOS field during the lifetime of a connection.
 So whether the type-of-service field can be changed after the
 TCP connection has been established depends on the implementation
 in the underlying platform. Applications should not assume that
 they can change the TOS field after the connection.
 
 For Internet Protocol v6 tc is the value that
 would be placed into the sin6_flowinfo field of the IP header.

Parameters:
tc - an int value for the bitset.

Sets the SO_RCVBUF option to the

 SO_RCVBUF option is
 used by the platform's networking code as a hint for the size to set
 the underlying network I/O buffers.

 Increasing the receive buffer size can increase the performance of
 network I/O for high-volume connection, while decreasing it can
 help reduce the backlog of incoming data.

 Because SO_RCVBUF is a hint,
 applications that want to verify what size the buffers were set to
 should call getReceiveBufferSize().

 The value of SO_RCVBUF is also used
 to set the TCP receive window that is advertized to the remote peer.
 Generally, the window size can be modified at any time when a socket is
 connected. However, if a receive window larger than 64K is required then
 this must be requested before the socket is connected to the
 remote peer. There are two cases to be aware of:
 
For sockets accepted from a ServerSocket, this must be done by calling
 ServerSocket.setReceiveBufferSize(int) before the ServerSocket
 is bound to a local address.
For client sockets, setReceiveBufferSize() must be called before
 connecting the socket to its remote peer.

Parameters:

 size. This value must be greater than 0.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the value is 0 or is

In this code snippet, we create a new `Socket` object and set the send buffer size to 1024. If there is any `SocketException`, it will be caught and printed to the console. If there is any other exception, it will also be caught and printed to the console.

Please replace "localhost" and 8080 with your actual host and port.

implies
public boolean implies(Permission p)
Checks if this socket permission object "implies" the
 specified permission.
 
 More specifically, this method first ensures that all of the following
 are true (and returns false if any of them are not):
 
 p is an instanceof SocketPermission,
  p's actions are a proper subset of this
 object's actions, and
  p's port range is included in this port range. Note:
 port range is ignored when p only contains the action, 'resolve'.
 

 Then implies checks each of the following, in order,
 and for each returns true if the stated condition is true:
 
 If this object was initialized with a single IP address and one of p's
 IP addresses is equal to this object's IP address.
 If this object is a wildcard domain (such as *.sun.com), and
 p's canonical name (the name without any preceding *)
 ends with this object's canonical host name. For example, *.sun.com
 implies *.eng.sun.com.
 If this object was not initialized with a single IP address, and one of this
 object's IP addresses equals one of p's IP addresses.
 If this canonical name equals p's canonical name.
 

 If none of the above are true, implies returns false.

Specified by:

Parameters:
p - the permission to check against.
Returns:
true if the specified permission is implied by this object,
 false if not.

If for the URL's protocol (such as HTTP or JAR), there
 exists a public, specialized URLConnection subclass belonging
 to one of the following packages or one of their subpackages:
 java.lang, java.io, java.util, java.net, the connection
 returned will be of that subclass. For example, for HTTP an
 HttpURLConnection will be returned, and for JAR a
 JarURLConnection will be returned.

Returns:
a URLConnection linking
             to the URL.
Throws:
IOException - if an I/O exception occurs.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `openConnection()` method from the `java.net.URL` class:

```java

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a new URL object with the URL of the website we want to connect to. Then we call the `openConnection()` method on this URL object, which returns a `URLConnection` object. This object represents a connection to the remote object referred to by the URL.

The `openConnection()` method does not establish the actual network connection on creation. This will happen only when calling `URLConnection.connect()`.

The `try-catch` block is used to handle any potential `IOException` that may occur when trying to open the connection. If an `IOException` does occur, it will be caught and printed to the console.

Here is a simple example of how to use the `setRequestProperty` method from `java.net.URLConnection`:

```java
import java.net.URL;
import java.net.URLConnection;
import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            URL url = new URL("http://example.com");
            URLConnection connection = url.openConnection();
            connection.setRequestProperty("User-Agent", "Mozilla/5.0");
            connection.connect();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we are setting the `User-Agent` request property to a custom value. This is a common way to identify your application when making HTTP requests.

Please replace `"http://example.com"` with the actual URL you want to connect to.

Note: The `setRequestProperty` method can be used to set any request property, not just `User-Agent`. The specific properties you can set depend on the protocol you are using (HTTP, FTP, etc.).

The `useCaches` field is a boolean that controls whether a URLConnection should use a URL cache. If `useCaches` is `true`, the URLConnection will attempt to retrieve data from the cache if it is available. If `useCaches` is `false`, the URLConnection will always retrieve data from the network.

In this code snippet, we first create a URL object. Then we open a connection to this URL using the `openConnection` method. After that, we set the connect timeout to 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) using the `setConnectTimeout` method.

Please replace `"http://example.com"` with the actual URL you want to connect to.

Note: This code snippet assumes that you have the necessary permissions to connect to the specified URL. If not, you may encounter `java.net.ConnectException`.

Here is the full description of the method: 


setReadTimeout
public void setReadTimeout(int timeout)
Sets the read timeout to a specified timeout, in
 milliseconds. A non-zero value specifies the timeout when
 reading from Input stream when a connection is established to a
 resource. If the timeout expires before there is data available
 for read, a java.net.SocketTimeoutException is raised. A
 timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout.

 Some non-standard implementation of this method ignores the
 specified timeout. To see the read timeout set, please call
 getReadTimeout().

Parameters:
timeout - an int that specifies the timeout
 value to be used in milliseconds
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the timeout parameter is negative
Since:
1.5

In this code, we first create a URL object and open a connection to it. Then we set the read timeout to 5000 milliseconds (or 5 seconds) using the `setReadTimeout` method. Finally, we print out the read timeout to confirm that it has been set correctly.

Please replace `"http://example.com"` with your actual URL.

Note: The `setReadTimeout` method is not commonly used in networking applications, as it can lead to unpredictable behavior and may not work as expected in all cases. It's generally better to use a timeout in the read operation itself, or to handle timeouts gracefully in your application.
