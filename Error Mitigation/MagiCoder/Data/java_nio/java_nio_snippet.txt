Here is the complete code snippet of the `capacity()` method from `java.nio.Buffer`:

```java
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(10);
        System.out.println("Capacity: " + buffer.capacity());
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are creating a `ByteBuffer` of capacity 10 and then calling the `capacity()` method to get the capacity of the buffer. The `capacity()` method returns the number of elements that can be held in the buffer.

Please note that the `capacity()` method is available in the `Buffer` interface and its implementations like `ByteBuffer`, `CharBuffer`, `DoubleBuffer`, `FloatBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, `LongBuffer`, `ShortBuffer`.

In this code, we create a `ByteBuffer` of size 10. We then print the initial position of the buffer. After putting a byte into the buffer, we print the position again. After calling the `flip()` method, we print the position again. Finally, after getting a byte from the buffer, we print the position again.

The `position()` method returns the current position of the buffer. The position is the index of the next element to be read or written. The position is initially 0. The position can be changed by calling the `put()`, `get()`, `mark()`, `reset()`, `rewind()`, `flip()`, or `compact()` methods.

        System.out.println("Position after reset: " + buffer.position());
    }
}
```

In this example, we first allocate a `ByteBuffer` of size 10. We then put some data into the buffer. We then mark the current position and move the position to 5. Finally, we reset the position to the mark and print the new position.

The output of this program will be:

```
Position after reset: 0
```

This shows that the position has been reset to the mark.

Here is a simple example of how to use the `allocate` method from `java.nio.ByteBuffer`:

```java
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Allocate a new byte buffer with a capacity of 10 bytes
        ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(10);

        // Print the capacity of the buffer
        System.out.println("Capacity: " + buffer.capacity());

        // Print the remaining elements in the buffer
        System.out.println("Remaining: " + buffer.remaining());

        // Print the position of the buffer
        System.out.println("Position: " + buffer.position());

        // Print the limit of the buffer
        System.out.println("Limit: " + buffer.limit());
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a new byte buffer with a capacity of 10 bytes. We then print out the capacity, remaining elements, position, and limit of the buffer.

The `capacity` method returns the number of elements that can be held in the buffer.

The `remaining` method returns the number of elements between the current position and the limit.

The `position` method returns the current position within the buffer.

The `limit` method returns the index of the first element that should not be read or written.

Relative bulk get method.

  This method transfers bytes from this buffer into the given
 destination array.  If there are fewer bytes remaining in the
 buffer than are required to satisfy the request, that is, if
 length > remaining(), then no
 bytes are transferred and a BufferUnderflowException is
 thrown.

  Otherwise, this method copies length bytes from this
 buffer into the given array, starting at the current position of this
 buffer and at the given offset in the array.  The position of this
 buffer is then incremented by length.

  In other words, an invocation of this method of the form

 except that it first checks that there are sufficient bytes in
 this buffer and it is potentially much more efficient.

Parameters:
dst - The array into which bytes are to be written

 to index zero, the double at index p + 1 is copied
 to index one, and so forth until the double at index
 limit() - 1 is copied to index
 n = limit() - 1 - p.
 The buffer's position is then set to n+1 and its limit is set to
 its capacity.  The mark, if defined, is discarded.

  The buffer's position is set to the number of doubles copied,
 rather than to zero, so that an invocation of this method can be
 followed immediately by an invocation of another relative put
 method. 

Returns:
This buffer
Throws:
ReadOnlyBufferException - If this buffer is read-only

Here is a complete code snippet of the DoubleBuffer compact() method:

```java
import java.nio.DoubleBuffer;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DoubleBuffer buffer = DoubleBuffer.allocate(10);

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            buffer.put(i * 1.0);
        }

        buffer.position(3);
        buffer.limit(7);

        System.out.println("Before compact():");
        printBuffer(buffer);

        buffer.compact();

        System.out.println("After compact():");
        printBuffer(buffer);

    private static void printBuffer(DoubleBuffer buffer) {
        buffer.flip();
        while (buffer.hasRemaining()) {
            System.out.print(buffer.get() + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
        buffer.clear();
    }
}
```

In this code, we first allocate a DoubleBuffer of size 10. We then put 5 doubles into the buffer. After that, we set the position to 3 and the limit to 7. Then we print the buffer before compacting it. After compacting, we print the buffer again.

The output of this code will be:

```
Before compact():
0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 
After compact():
3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 
```

As you can see, the doubles between the position and the limit have been compacted to the beginning of the buffer.

In this example, we first create an `originalBuffer` of size 5 and fill it with some float values. We then flip the buffer to prepare it for reading.

Next, we call the `duplicate()` method on the `originalBuffer`, which creates a new `FloatBuffer` that shares the same content as the original buffer.

Finally, we read the content of the duplicate buffer and print it to the console.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `put` method from `java.nio.IntBuffer`:

import java.nio.IntBuffer;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntBuffer buffer = IntBuffer.allocate(10);
        buffer.put(0, 10);
        buffer.flip();
        System.out.println(buffer.get(0));
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first allocate an `IntBuffer` of size 10. Then we put the integer 10 at the 0th index of the buffer. After that, we flip the buffer to prepare it for reading. Finally, we print the value at the 0th index of the buffer.

Please note that you need to call `flip()` before reading from the buffer. If you don't call `flip()`, the `get()` method will throw a `BufferUnderflowException`.

compact
public abstract IntBuffer compact()
Compacts this buffer  (optional operation).

  The ints between the buffer's current position and its limit,
 if any, are copied to the beginning of the buffer.  That is, the
 int at index p = position() is copied
 to index zero, the int at index p + 1 is copied
 to index one, and so forth until the int at index
 limit() - 1 is copied to index
 n = limit() - 1 - p.
 The buffer's position is then set to n+1 and its limit is set to
 its capacity.  The mark, if defined, is discarded.

  The buffer's position is set to the number of ints copied,

compact
public abstract LongBuffer compact()
Compacts this buffer  (optional operation).

  The longs between the buffer's current position and its limit,
 if any, are copied to the beginning of the buffer.  That is, the
 long at index p = position() is copied
 to index zero, the long at index p + 1 is copied
 to index one, and so forth until the long at index
 limit() - 1 is copied to index
 n = limit() - 1 - p.
 The buffer's position is then set to n+1 and its limit is set to
 its capacity.  The mark, if defined, is discarded.

  The buffer's position is set to the number of longs copied,
 rather than to zero, so that an invocation of this method can be
 followed immediately by an invocation of another relative put
 method.

put
public LongBuffer put(LongBuffer src)
Relative bulk put method  (optional operation).

  This method transfers the longs remaining in the given source
 buffer into this buffer.  If there are more longs remaining in the
 source buffer than in this buffer, that is, if
 src.remaining() > remaining(),
 then no longs are transferred and a BufferOverflowException is thrown.

  Otherwise, this method copies
 n = src.remaining() longs from the given
 buffer into this buffer, starting at each buffer's current position.
 The positions of both buffers are then incremented by n.

  In other words, an invocation of this method of the form
 dst.put(src) has exactly the same effect as the loop

 
     while (src.hasRemaining())
         dst.put(src.get()); 

 except that it first checks that there is sufficient space in this
 buffer and it is potentially much more efficient.

Parameters:
src - The source buffer from which longs are to be read;
         must not be this buffer
Returns:
This buffer
Throws:
BufferOverflowException - If there is insufficient space in this buffer
