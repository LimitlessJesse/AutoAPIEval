@@ Context
Here is the description of the package Allows developers to provide support for undo/redoin applications such as text editors.
Here is the description of the class An abstract implementation of UndoableEdit, implementing simple responses to all boolean methods in that interface.

@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.swing.undo.AbstractUndoableEdit package from Java
Given the context, recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, 
Do not recommend methods inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
1. `boolean canUndo()`: This method returns true if this edit can be undone.
2. `boolean canRedo()`: This method returns true if this edit can be redone.
3. `void undo()`: This method performs the undo operation.
4. `void redo()`: This method performs the redo operation.
5. `String getPresentationName()`: This method returns a string describing the operation that this edit represents.
