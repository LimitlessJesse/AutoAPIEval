eval
public Object eval(String script)
            throws ScriptException
Same as eval(Reader) except that the abstract
 eval(String, ScriptContext) is used.

Specified by:
eval in interface ScriptEngine
Parameters:
script - A String containing the source of the script.
Returns:
The return value from eval(String, ScriptContext)
Throws:
ScriptException - if an error occurs in script.
NullPointerException - if any of the parameters is null.

Code snippet:

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `eval` method from `javax.script.AbstractScriptEngine`:

```java

import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;
import javax.script.ScriptException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("JavaScript");

        try {

        } catch (ScriptException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are using a JavaScript engine to evaluate a simple script that adds two numbers. The `eval` method returns an `Object`, so we need to cast it to the appropriate type (in this case, an `int`). If an error occurs in the script, a `ScriptException` is thrown.

  If one is not found, it searches the set of ScriptEngineFactory instances
 stored by the constructor for one with the specified name.  If a ScriptEngineFactory
 is found by either method, it is used to create instance of ScriptEngine.

Parameters:

A ScriptEngine created by the factory located in the search.  Returns null

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);

Here is a complete code snippet of the `clear()` method from `javax.script.SimpleBindings`:

```java
import javax.script.SimpleBindings;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SimpleBindings bindings = new SimpleBindings();
        bindings.put("name", "John");
        bindings.put("age", 30);

        System.out.println("Bindings before clear: " + bindings);

        bindings.clear();

        System.out.println("Bindings after clear: " + bindings);
    }
}
```

In this code, we first create a `SimpleBindings` object and add some bindings to it. Then we print the bindings before and after calling the `clear()` method. After calling `clear()`, the bindings are empty.

getAttribute
public Object getAttribute(String name)
Retrieves the value of the attribute with the given name in
 the scope occurring earliest in the search order.  The order
 is determined by the numeric value of the scope parameter (lowest
 scope values first.)

Specified by:
getAttribute in interface ScriptContext
Parameters:
name - The name of the the attribute to retrieve.
Returns:
The value of the attribute in the lowest scope for
 which an attribute with the given name is defined.  Returns
 null if no attribute with the name exists in any scope.
Throws:
NullPointerException - if the name is null.
IllegalArgumentException - if the name is empty.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `getAttribute` method from `javax.script.SimpleScriptContext`:

```java
import javax.script.ScriptContext;
import javax.script.SimpleScriptContext;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScriptContext context = new SimpleScriptContext();
        context.setAttribute("name", "John", ScriptContext.ENGINE_SCOPE);
        Object attribute = context.getAttribute("name");
        System.out.println(attribute);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a new `ScriptContext` object using `SimpleScriptContext`. We then set an attribute "name" with the value "John" in the `ENGINE_SCOPE`. Finally, we retrieve the attribute "name" from the context and print its value.

Please note that the `getAttribute` method will return `null` if no attribute with the given name exists in any scope.

The output will be `null` because the attribute "name" has been removed.

        SimpleScriptContext context = new SimpleScriptContext();

```

In this code, we create a new `SimpleScriptContext` object and then call the `setAttribute` method on it. The first argument is the name of the attribute, the second argument is the value of the attribute, and the third argument is the scope in which to set the attribute. In this case, we are setting the attribute in the `ENGINE_SCOPE`, which is a scope that is specific to the script engine.

Please note that you need to have the necessary import statement at the top of your file to use the `SimpleScriptContext` class.
