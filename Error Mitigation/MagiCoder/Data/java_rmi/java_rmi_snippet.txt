Here is the description of the class: The Naming class provides methods for storing and obtaining references to remote objects in a remote object registry.
Here is the full description of the method: 


unbind
public static void unbind(String name)
                   throws RemoteException,
                          NotBoundException,
                          MalformedURLException
Destroys the binding for the specified name that is associated
 with a remote object.

Parameters:
name - a name in URL format (without the scheme component)
Throws:
NotBoundException - if name is not currently bound
MalformedURLException - if the name is not an appropriately
  formatted URL
RemoteException - if registry could not be contacted
AccessException - if this operation is not permitted (if
 originating from a non-local host, for example)
Since:
JDK1.1

Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is a complete code snippet of the `unbind` method from the `java.rmi.Naming` class:

```java
import java.rmi.Naming;
import java.rmi.NotBoundException;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.net.MalformedURLException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Naming.unbind("rmi://localhost:1099/MyObject");
            System.out.println("Unbound successfully");
        } catch (NotBoundException | MalformedURLException | RemoteException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are trying to unbind the remote object named "MyObject" from the RMI registry running on localhost at port 1099. If the unbind operation is successful, it prints "Unbound successfully". If any exception occurs, it is caught and printed to the console.

Please replace "rmi://localhost:1099/MyObject" with the actual URL of the remote object you want to unbind.

Note: You need to have the necessary permissions to unbind a remote object. If you are running this code on a remote machine, you may need to use a different URL scheme (like rmi+http, rmi+https, etc.) and ensure that the necessary ports are open.

                     throws RemoteException,
                            MalformedURLException
Returns an array of the names bound in the registry.  The names are
 URL-formatted (without the scheme component) strings. The array contains
 a snapshot of the names present in the registry at the time of the
 call.

Parameters:
name - a registry name in URL format (without the scheme
          component)
Returns:
an array of names (in the appropriate format) bound
          in the registry
Throws:
MalformedURLException - if the name is not an appropriately
  formatted URL
RemoteException - if registry could not be contacted.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `list` method from `java.rmi.Naming`:

```java
import java.rmi.Naming;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.net.MalformedURLException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            String[] names = Naming.list("rmi://localhost:1099/");
            for (String name : names) {
                System.out.println(name);
            }
        } catch (RemoteException | MalformedURLException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are using the `Naming.list` method to list all the names bound in the registry at the specified URL. The URL "rmi://localhost:1099/" is an example and should be replaced with the actual URL of the registry.

The `try-catch` block is used to handle `RemoteException` and `MalformedURLException` that may be thrown by the `Naming.list` method.

Please note that you need to replace "rmi://localhost:1099/" with the actual URL of the registry you are using. Also, you need to have the necessary permissions to access the registry.
