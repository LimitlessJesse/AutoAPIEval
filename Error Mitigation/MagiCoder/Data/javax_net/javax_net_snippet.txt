For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `getDefault()` method from `javax.net.ServerSocketFactory`:

```java
import javax.net.ServerSocketFactory;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ServerSocketFactory serverSocketFactory = ServerSocketFactory.getDefault();
        System.out.println(serverSocketFactory);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are importing the `ServerSocketFactory` class from the `javax.net` package. Then, we are calling the `getDefault()` method on the `ServerSocketFactory` class to get the default server socket factory. Finally, we are printing the server socket factory to the console.

Please note that the `getDefault()` method returns the default server socket factory for the environment. The specific implementation of the server socket factory can vary based on the environment, such as the JVM or the operating system.

 If there is a security manager, its checkListen

In this code snippet, we are using `ServerSocketFactory.getDefault().createServerSocket(8080)` to create a server socket on port 8080. If there is a problem with the socket (like the port is already in use), a `SocketException` will be thrown. If there is a problem with the input/output (like the port number is invalid), an `IOException` will be thrown.

Please note that you need to import the necessary classes and packages to make this code work. The `ServerSocketFactory` class is part of the `java.net` package, and the `ServerSocket` class is part of the `java.net` package.
