@@ Context
Here is the description of the package: This package contains the core JAX-WS APIs.
Here is the description of the class: This feature clarifies the use of the wsdl:binding in a JAX-WS runtime.
Here is the full description of the method: 


getID
public String getID()
Get the unique identifier for this WebServiceFeature.

Specified by:
getID in class WebServiceFeature
Returns:
the unique identifier for this feature.

I want to learn how to use String getID() from javax.xml.ws.RespectBindingFeature
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

The `getID()` method in `javax.xml.ws.RespectBindingFeature` is used to get the unique identifier for this WebServiceFeature.

Here is a complete code snippet of this method:

```java
import javax.xml.ws.RespectBindingFeature;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RespectBindingFeature feature = new RespectBindingFeature();
        String id = feature.getID();
        System.out.println("ID: " + id);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new instance of `RespectBindingFeature` and call the `getID()` method. The returned ID is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `getID()` method is not a standard method and it may not work as expected in all scenarios. It's also worth noting that the `RespectBindingFeature` class is not part of the standard Java API and it's likely that it's a custom class or a part of a specific library.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `isEnabled()` method from `javax.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature`:

```java
import javax.xml.ws.WebServiceFeature;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WebServiceFeature feature = new WebServiceFeature() {
            @Override
            public boolean isEnabled() {
                return true; // or false, depending on your needs
            }
        };

        System.out.println(feature.isEnabled());
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a new `WebServiceFeature` object and override the `isEnabled()` method. We then call `isEnabled()` on the feature and print the result.

Please note that the `isEnabled()` method is a placeholder and you should replace it with your actual implementation.
