Instrument,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/Instrument.html,"An instrument is a sound-synthesis algorithm with certain parameter settings, usually designed to emulate a specific real-world musical instrument or to achieve a specific sort of sound effect."
MetaMessage,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/MetaMessage.html,"A MetaMessage is a MidiMessage that is not meaningful to synthesizers, but that can be stored in a MIDI file and interpreted by a sequencer program."
MidiDevice.Info,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/MidiDevice.Info.html,"A MidiDevice.Info object contains assorted data about a MidiDevice, including its name, the company who created it, and descriptive text."
MidiEvent,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/MidiEvent.html,"MIDI events contain a MIDI message and a corresponding time-stamp expressed in ticks, and can represent the MIDI event information stored in a MIDI file or a Sequence object."
MidiFileFormat,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/MidiFileFormat.html,"A MidiFileFormat object encapsulates a MIDI file's type, as well as its length and timing information."
MidiMessage,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/MidiMessage.html,MidiMessage is the base class for MIDI messages.
MidiSystem,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/MidiSystem.html,"The MidiSystem class provides access to the installed MIDI system resources, including devices such as synthesizers, sequencers, and MIDI input and output ports."
Patch,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/Patch.html,"A Patch object represents a location, on a MIDI synthesizer, into which a single instrument is stored (loaded)."
Sequence,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/Sequence.html,A Sequence is a data structure containing musical information (often an entire song or composition) that can be played back by a Sequencer object.
Sequencer.SyncMode,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/Sequencer.SyncMode.html,A SyncMode object represents one of the ways in which a MIDI sequencer's notion of time can be synchronized with a master or slave device.
ShortMessage,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/ShortMessage.html,A ShortMessage contains a MIDI message that has at most two data bytes following its status byte.
SoundbankResource,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/SoundbankResource.html,A SoundbankResource represents any audio resource stored in a Soundbank.
SysexMessage,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/SysexMessage.html,A SysexMessage object represents a MIDI system exclusive message.
Track,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/Track.html,A MIDI track is an independent stream of MIDI events (time-stamped MIDI data) that can be stored along with other tracks in a standard MIDI file.
VoiceStatus,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/VoiceStatus.html,A VoiceStatus object contains information about the current status of one of the voices produced by a Synthesizer.
