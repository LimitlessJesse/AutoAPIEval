ClassName,Method,Return Type,Description,Full Description
StreamResult,getOutputStream(),OutputStream,Get the byte stream that was set with setOutputStream.,"

getOutputStream
public OutputStream getOutputStream()
Get the byte stream that was set with setOutputStream.

Returns:
The byte stream that was set with setOutputStream, or null
 if setOutputStream or the ByteStream constructor was not called.


"
StreamResult,getSystemId(),String,Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.,"

getSystemId
public String getSystemId()
Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.

Specified by:
getSystemId in interface Result
Returns:
The system identifier that was set with setSystemId, or null
 if setSystemId was not called.


"
StreamResult,getWriter(),Writer,Get the character stream that was set with setWriter.,"

getWriter
public Writer getWriter()
Get the character stream that was set with setWriter.

Returns:
The character stream that was set with setWriter, or null
 if setWriter or the Writer constructor was not called.


"
StreamResult,setOutputStream(OutputStream outputStream),void,Set the ByteStream that is to be written to.,"

setOutputStream
public void setOutputStream(OutputStream outputStream)
Set the ByteStream that is to be written to.  Normally,
 a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that
 the transformer may use instructions contained in the
 transformation instructions to control the encoding.

Parameters:
outputStream - A valid OutputStream reference.


"
StreamResult,setSystemId(File f),void,Set the system ID from a File reference.,"

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(File f)
Set the system ID from a File reference.

Parameters:
f - Must a non-null File reference.


"
StreamResult,setSystemId(String systemId),void,"Set the systemID that may be used in association with the byte or character stream, or, if neither is set, use this value as a writeable URI (probably a file name).","

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(String systemId)
Set the systemID that may be used in association
 with the byte or character stream, or, if neither is set, use
 this value as a writeable URI (probably a file name).

Specified by:
setSystemId in interface Result
Parameters:
systemId - The system identifier as a URI string.


"
StreamResult,setWriter(Writer writer),void,Set the writer that is to receive the result.,"

setWriter
public void setWriter(Writer writer)
Set the writer that is to receive the result.  Normally,
 a stream should be used rather than a writer, so that
 the transformer may use instructions contained in the
 transformation instructions to control the encoding.  However,
 there are times when it is useful to write to a writer,
 such as when using a StringWriter.

Parameters:
writer - A valid Writer reference.


"
StreamSource,getInputStream(),InputStream,Get the byte stream that was set with setByteStream.,"

getInputStream
public InputStream getInputStream()
Get the byte stream that was set with setByteStream.

Returns:
The byte stream that was set with setByteStream, or null
 if setByteStream or the ByteStream constructor was not called.


"
StreamSource,getPublicId(),String,Get the public identifier that was set with setPublicId.,"

getPublicId
public String getPublicId()
Get the public identifier that was set with setPublicId.

Returns:
The public identifier that was set with setPublicId, or null
 if setPublicId was not called.


"
StreamSource,getReader(),Reader,Get the character stream that was set with setReader.,"

getReader
public Reader getReader()
Get the character stream that was set with setReader.

Returns:
The character stream that was set with setReader, or null
 if setReader or the Reader constructor was not called.


"
StreamSource,getSystemId(),String,Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.,"

getSystemId
public String getSystemId()
Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.

Specified by:
getSystemId in interface Source
Returns:
The system identifier that was set with setSystemId, or null
 if setSystemId was not called.


"
StreamSource,setInputStream(InputStream inputStream),void,Set the byte stream to be used as input.,"

setInputStream
public void setInputStream(InputStream inputStream)
Set the byte stream to be used as input.  Normally,
 a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that
 the XML parser can resolve character encoding specified
 by the XML declaration.

 If this Source object is used to process a stylesheet, normally
 setSystemId should also be called, so that relative URL references
 can be resolved.

Parameters:
inputStream - A valid InputStream reference to an XML stream.


"
StreamSource,setPublicId(String publicId),void,Set the public identifier for this Source.,"

setPublicId
public void setPublicId(String publicId)
Set the public identifier for this Source.

 The public identifier is always optional: if the application
 writer includes one, it will be provided as part of the
 location information.

Parameters:
publicId - The public identifier as a string.


"
StreamSource,setReader(Reader reader),void,Set the input to be a character reader.,"

setReader
public void setReader(Reader reader)
Set the input to be a character reader.  Normally,
 a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that
 the XML parser can resolve character encoding specified
 by the XML declaration.  However, in many cases the encoding
 of the input stream is already resolved, as in the case of
 reading XML from a StringReader.

Parameters:
reader - A valid Reader reference to an XML CharacterStream.


"
StreamSource,setSystemId(File f),void,Set the system ID from a File reference.,"

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(File f)
Set the system ID from a File reference.

Parameters:
f - Must a non-null File reference.


"
StreamSource,setSystemId(String systemId),void,Set the system identifier for this Source.,"

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(String systemId)
Set the system identifier for this Source.

 The system identifier is optional if there is a byte stream
 or a character stream, but it is still useful to provide one,
 since the application can use it to resolve relative URIs
 and can include it in error messages and warnings (the parser
 will attempt to open a connection to the URI only if
 there is no byte stream or character stream specified).

Specified by:
setSystemId in interface Source
Parameters:
systemId - The system identifier as a URL string.
