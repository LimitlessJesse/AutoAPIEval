0,StreamResult,5,void setWriter(Writer writer),True,Set the writer that is to receive the result.,"

setWriter
public void setWriter(Writer writer)
Set the writer that is to receive the result.  Normally,
 a stream should be used rather than a writer, so that
 the transformer may use instructions contained in the
 transformation instructions to control the encoding.  However,
 there are times when it is useful to write to a writer,
 such as when using a StringWriter.

Parameters:
writer - A valid Writer reference.


"
0,StreamResult,6,void setOutputStream(OutputStream outputStream),True,Set the ByteStream that is to be written to.,"

setOutputStream
public void setOutputStream(OutputStream outputStream)
Set the ByteStream that is to be written to.  Normally,
 a stream should be used rather than a reader, so that
 the transformer may use instructions contained in the
 transformation instructions to control the encoding.

Parameters:
outputStream - A valid OutputStream reference.


"
0,StreamResult,7,void setSystemId(String systemId),True,"Set the systemID that may be used in association with the byte or character stream, or, if neither is set, use this value as a writeable URI (probably a file name).","

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(String systemId)
Set the systemID that may be used in association
 with the byte or character stream, or, if neither is set, use
 this value as a writeable URI (probably a file name).

Specified by:
setSystemId in interface Result
Parameters:
systemId - The system identifier as a URI string.


"
0,StreamResult,8,Writer getWriter(),True,Get the character stream that was set with setWriter.,"

getWriter
public Writer getWriter()
Get the character stream that was set with setWriter.

Returns:
The character stream that was set with setWriter, or null
 if setWriter or the Writer constructor was not called.


"
0,StreamResult,9,OutputStream getOutputStream(),True,Get the byte stream that was set with setOutputStream.,"

getOutputStream
public OutputStream getOutputStream()
Get the byte stream that was set with setOutputStream.

Returns:
The byte stream that was set with setOutputStream, or null
 if setOutputStream or the ByteStream constructor was not called.


"
0,StreamResult,10,String getSystemId(),True,Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.,"

getSystemId
public String getSystemId()
Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.

Specified by:
getSystemId in interface Result
Returns:
The system identifier that was set with setSystemId, or null
 if setSystemId was not called.
