 to the given TypeCode object and clears its value.
 
 Note that using this method to set the type code wipes out the
 value if there is one. The method
 is provided primarily so that the type may be set properly for
 IDL out parameters.  Generally, setting the type
 is done by the insert_X methods, which will set the type
 to X if it is not already set to X.

Parameters:
t - the TypeCode object giving
                information for the value in
                this Any object

 and value need to be written, use
 create_output_stream() to create an OutputStream,
 then use write_any on the OutputStream.
 
 If this method is called on an Any object that has not
 had a value inserted into its value field, it will throw
 the exception java.lang.NullPointerException.

Parameters:
os - the org.omg.CORBA.portable.OutputStream
                object into which to marshal the value
                of this Any object

"
Context,create_child(String child_ctx_name),abstract Context,Creates a Context object with the given string as its name and with this Context object set as its parent.,"

create_child
public abstract Context create_child(String child_ctx_name)
Creates a Context object with the given string as its
 name and with this Context object set as its parent.
 
 The new Context object is chained into its parent
 Context object.  This means that in a search for
 matching property names, if a match is not found in this context,
 the search will continue in the parent.  If that is not successful,
 the search will continue in the grandparent, if there is one, and
 so on.

Parameters:
child_ctx_name - the String object to be set as
                        the name of the new Context object
Returns:
the newly-created child Context object

 trailing wildcard character (""*""), then
 all NamedValue objects whose name
 fields match will be deleted. The search scope is always
 limited to this Context object.
 
 If no matching property is found, an exception is returned.

Parameters:

                                  String pattern)
Retrieves the NamedValue objects whose
 name field matches the given name or name
 pattern.   This method allows for wildcard searches,
 which means that there can be multiple matches and
 therefore multiple values returned. If the
 property is not found at the indicated level, the search
 continues up the context object tree until a match is found or
 all Context objects in the chain have been exhausted.
 
 If no match is found, an error is returned and no property list
 is returned.

Parameters:
start_scope - a String object indicating the
                context object level at which to initiate the
                          search for the specified properties
                          (for example, ""_USER"", ""_GROUP"", ""_SYSTEM""). Valid scope
                          names are implementation-specific. If a
                          scope name is omitted, the search
                          begins with the specified context
                          object. If the specified scope name is
                          not found, an exception is returned.
op_flags - an operation flag.  The one flag
                that may be specified is CTX_RESTRICT_SCOPE.
                If this flag is specified, searching is limited to the
                          specified start_scope or this
                Context object.
pattern - the property name whose values are to
                          be retrieved. pattern may be a
                name or a name with a
                          trailing wildcard character (""*"").
Returns:
an NVList containing all the property values
                (in the form of NamedValue objects)
                whose associated property name matches the given name or
                name pattern

Creates a NamedValue object and adds it to this
 Context object.  The name field of the
 new NamedValue object is set to the given string,
 the value field is set to the given Any
 object, and the flags field is set to zero.

Parameters:
propname - the name of the property to be set
propvalue - the Any object to which the
                        value of the property will be set.  The
                        Any object's value
                        field contains the value to be associated
                        with the given propname; the
                        kind field must be set to
                        TCKind.tk_string.


"

set_values
public abstract void set_values(NVList values)
I Sets one or more property values in this Context
 object. The NVList supplied to this method
 contains one or more NamedValue objects.
 In each NamedValue object,
 the name field holds the name of the property, and
 the flags field must be set to zero.
 The NamedValue object's value field
 contains an Any object, which, in turn, contains the value
 for the property.  Since the value is always a string,
 the Any object must have the kind
 field of its TypeCode set to TCKind.tk_string.

Parameters:
values - an NVList containing the property
                                    names and associated values to be set

_releaseReply
public void _releaseReply(InputStream input)
Throws an org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT exception with
 the message ""This is a locally constrained object.""
 This method is the default implementation of the
 org.omg.CORBA.Object method.
 May optionally be called by a stub to release a
 reply stream back to the ORB when the unmarshaling has
 completed. The stub passes the InputStream returned by
 _invoke() or
 ApplicationException.getInputStream().
 A null
 value may also be passed to _releaseReply, in which case the
 method is a no-op.

Parameters:
input - the reply stream back to the ORB or null
Throws:
NO_IMPLEMENT

ORB,connect(Object obj),void,Connects the given servant object (a Java object that is an instance of the server implementation class) to the ORB.,"

connect
public void connect(Object obj)
Connects the given servant object (a Java object that is
 an instance of the server implementation class)
 to the ORB. The servant class must
 extend the ImplBase class corresponding to the interface that is
 supported by the server. The servant must thus be a CORBA object
 reference, and inherit from org.omg.CORBA.Object.
 Servants created by the user can start receiving remote invocations
 after the method connect has been called. A servant may also be
 automatically and implicitly connected to the ORB if it is passed as
 an IDL parameter in an IDL method invocation on a non-local object,
 that is, if the servant object has to be marshalled and sent outside of the
 process address space.
 
 Calling the method connect has no effect
 when the servant object is already connected to the ORB.
 
 Deprecated by the OMG in favor of the Portable Object Adapter APIs.

Parameters:
obj - The servant object reference

 For the IDL struct Node in following code fragment,
 the offset parameter for creating its sequence would be 1:
 
    Struct Node {
        long value;
        Sequence <Node> subnodes;
    };
 

Parameters:
bound - the bound for the sequence, 0 if unbounded
offset - the index to the enclosing TypeCode object
                  that describes the elements of this sequence

"
ORB,create_recursive_tc(String id),TypeCode,Create a recursive TypeCode object which serves as a placeholder for a concrete TypeCode during the process of creating TypeCodes which contain recursion.,"

create_recursive_tc
public TypeCode create_recursive_tc(String id)
Create a recursive TypeCode object which
 serves as a placeholder for a concrete TypeCode during the process of creating
 TypeCodes which contain recursion. The id parameter specifies the repository id of
 the type for which the recursive TypeCode is serving as a placeholder. Once the
 recursive TypeCode has been properly embedded in the enclosing TypeCode which
 corresponds to the specified repository id, it will function as a normal TypeCode.
 Invoking operations on the recursive TypeCode before it has been embedded in the
 enclosing TypeCode will result in a BAD_TYPECODE exception.
 
 For example, the following IDL type declaration contains recursion:
 
    Struct Node {
        Sequence<Node> subnodes;
    };
 

 To create a TypeCode for struct Node, you would invoke the TypeCode creation
 operations as shown below:
 
 String nodeID = ""IDL:Node:1.0"";
 TypeCode recursiveSeqTC = orb.create_sequence_tc(0, orb.create_recursive_tc(nodeID));
 StructMember[] members = { new StructMember(""subnodes"", recursiveSeqTC, null) };
 TypeCode structNodeTC = orb.create_struct_tc(nodeID, ""Node"", members);
 

 Also note that the following is an illegal IDL type declaration:
 
    Struct Node {
        Node next;
    };
 

 Recursive types can only appear within sequences which can be empty.
 That way marshaling problems, when transmitting the struct in an Any, are avoided.
 

Parameters:
id - the logical id of the referenced type
Returns:
the requested TypeCode

"
ORB,destroy(),void,Destroys the ORB so that its resources can be reclaimed.,"

destroy
public void destroy()
Destroys the ORB so that its resources can be reclaimed.
 Any operation invoked on a destroyed ORB reference will throw the
 OBJECT_NOT_EXIST exception.
 Once an ORB has been destroyed, another call to init
 with the same ORBid will return a reference to a newly constructed ORB.
 If destroy is called on an ORB that has not been shut down,
 it will start the shut down process and block until the ORB has shut down
 before it destroys the ORB.
 If an application calls destroy in a thread that is currently servicing
 an invocation, the BAD_INV_ORDER system exception will be thrown
 with the OMG minor code 3, since blocking would result in a deadlock.
 For maximum portability and to avoid resource leaks, an application should
 always call shutdown and destroy
 on all ORB instances before exiting.

Throws:
BAD_INV_ORDER - if the current thread is servicing an invocation


"
ORB,disconnect(Object obj),void,Disconnects the given servant object from the ORB.,"

disconnect
public void disconnect(Object obj)
Disconnects the given servant object from the ORB. After this method returns,
 the ORB will reject incoming remote requests for the disconnected
 servant and will send the exception
 org.omg.CORBA.OBJECT_NOT_EXIST back to the
 remote client. Thus the object appears to be destroyed from the
 point of view of remote clients. Note, however, that local requests issued
 using the servant  directly do not
 pass through the ORB; hence, they will continue to be processed by the
 servant.
 
 Calling the method disconnect has no effect
 if the servant is not connected to the ORB.
 
 Deprecated by the OMG in favor of the Portable Object Adapter APIs.

Parameters:
obj - The servant object to be disconnected from the ORB

 services type is available, the operation returns false
  (i.e., the service is not supported by this ORB).
 

Parameters:
service_type - a short indicating the
        service type for which information is being requested
service_info - a ServiceInformationHolder object
        that will hold the ServiceInformation object
        produced by this method

"
ORB,init(),static ORB,Returns the ORB singleton object.,"

init
public static ORB init()
Returns the ORB singleton object. This method always returns the
 same ORB instance, which is an instance of the class described by the
 org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass system property.
 
 This no-argument version of the method init is used primarily
 as a factory for TypeCode objects, which are used by
 Helper classes to implement the method type.
 It is also used to create Any objects that are used to
 describe union labels (as part of creating a 
 TypeCode object for a union).
 
 This method is not intended to be used by applets, and in the event
 that it is called in an applet environment, the ORB it returns
 is restricted so that it can be used only as a factory for
 TypeCode objects.  Any TypeCode objects
 it produces can be safely shared among untrusted applets.
 
 If an ORB is created using this method from an applet,
 a system exception will be thrown if
 methods other than those for
 creating TypeCode objects are invoked.

Returns:
the singleton ORB

"
ORB,shutdown(boolean wait_for_completion),void,"Instructs the ORB to shut down, which causes all object adapters to shut down, in preparation for destruction. If the wait_for_completion parameter is true, this operation blocks until all ORB processing (including processing of currently executing requests, object deactivation, and other object adapter operations) has completed.","

shutdown
public void shutdown(boolean wait_for_completion)
Instructs the ORB to shut down, which causes all
 object adapters to shut down, in preparation for destruction.
 If the wait_for_completion parameter
 is true, this operation blocks until all ORB processing (including
 processing of currently executing requests, object deactivation,
 and other object adapter operations) has completed.
 If an application does this in a thread that is currently servicing
 an invocation, the BAD_INV_ORDER system exception
 will be thrown with the OMG minor code 3,
 since blocking would result in a deadlock.
 If the wait_for_completion parameter is FALSE,
 then shutdown may not have completed upon return.
 While the ORB is in the process of shutting down, the ORB operates as normal,
 servicing incoming and outgoing requests until all requests have been completed.
 Once an ORB has shutdown, only object reference management operations
 may be invoked on the ORB or any object reference obtained from it.
 An application may also invoke the destroy operation on the ORB itself.
 Invoking any other operation will throw the BAD_INV_ORDER
 system exception with the OMG minor code 4.
 The ORB.run method will return after
 shutdown has been called.

Parameters:
wait_for_completion - true if the call
        should block until the shutdown is complete;
        false if it should return immediately
Throws:
BAD_INV_ORDER - if the current thread is servicing
         an invocation

true if there is work pending, meaning that the ORB
         needs the main thread to perform some work; false
         if there is no work pending and thus the ORB does not need the
         main thread

"
ServerRequest,arguments(NVList args),void,"Specifies method parameter types and retrieves ""in"" and ""inout"" argument values.","

arguments
public void arguments(NVList args)
Specifies method parameter types and retrieves ""in"" and ""inout""
 argument values.
 Unless it calls the method set_exception,
 the DIR must call this method exactly once, even if the
 method signature contains no parameters. Once the method 
 arguments or set_exception
 has been called, calling arguments on the same
 ServerRequest object
 will result in a BAD_INV_ORDER system exception.
 The DIR must pass in to the method arguments
 an NVList initialized with TypeCodes and Flags
 describing the parameter types for the operation, in the order in which
 they appear in the IDL specification (left to right). A
 potentially-different NVList will be returned from
 arguments, with the
 ""in"" and ""inout"" argument values supplied. If it does not call
 the method set_exception,
 the DIR must supply the returned NVList with return
 values for any ""out"" arguments before returning, and it may also change
 the return values for any ""inout"" arguments.

Parameters:
args - the arguments of the method, in the
                            form of an NVList

 been called or after the method ctx,
 set_result, or set_exception
 has been called will result in a
 BAD_INV_ORDER system exception.

Returns:

"
ServerRequest,except(Any any),void,Deprecated. use set_exception(),"

except
@Deprecated
public void except(Any any)
Deprecated. use set_exception()
The DIR may call set_exception at any time to return an exception to the
 client. The Any passed to set_exception must contain either a system
 exception or a user exception specified in the raises expression
 of the invoked operation's IDL definition. Passing in an Any that does
 not
 contain an exception will result in a BAD_PARAM system exception. Passing
 in an unlisted user exception will result in either the DIR receiving a
 BAD_PARAM system exception or in the client receiving an
 UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION system exception.

Parameters:
any - the Any object containing the exception


"
ServerRequest,op_name(),String,Deprecated. use operation(),"

op_name
@Deprecated
public String op_name()
Deprecated. use operation()
Retrieves the name of the operation being
 invoked. According to OMG IDL's rules, these names must be unique
 among all operations supported by this object's ""most-derived""
 interface. Note that the operation names for getting and setting
 attributes are _get_<attribute_name>
 and _set_<attribute_name>,
 respectively.

Returns:
the name of the operation to be invoked


"
ServerRequest,operation(),String,Throws an org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT exception.,"

operation
public String operation()
Throws an org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT exception.
 
 Retrieves the name of the operation being
 invoked. According to OMG IDL's rules, these names must be unique
 among all operations supported by this object's ""most-derived""
 interface. Note that the operation names for getting and setting
 attributes are _get_<attribute_name>
 and _set_<attribute_name>,
 respectively.

Returns:
the name of the operation to be invoked

"
ServerRequest,params(NVList params),void,Deprecated. use the method arguments,"

params
@Deprecated
public void params(NVList params)
Deprecated. use the method arguments
Specifies method parameter types and retrieves ""in"" and ""inout""
 argument values.
 
 Note that this method is deprecated; use the method
 arguments in its place.
 
 Unless it calls the method set_exception,
 the DIR must call this method exactly once, even if the
 method signature contains no parameters. Once the method 
 arguments or set_exception
 has been called, calling arguments on the same
 ServerRequest object
 will result in a BAD_INV_ORDER system exception.
 The DIR must pass in to the method arguments
 an NVList initialized with TypeCodes and Flags
 describing the parameter types for the operation, in the order in which
 they appear in the IDL specification (left to right). A
 potentially-different NVList will be returned from
 arguments, with the
 ""in"" and ""inout"" argument values supplied. If it does not call
 the method set_exception,
 the DIR must supply the returned NVList with return
 values for any ""out"" arguments before returning, and may also change
 the return values for any ""inout"" arguments.

Parameters:
params - the arguments of the method, in the
                          form of an NVList object


"
ServerRequest,result(Any any),void,Deprecated. use the method set_result,"

result
@Deprecated
public void result(Any any)
Deprecated. use the method set_result
Specifies any return value for the call.
 
 Note that this method is deprecated; use the method
 set_result in its place.
 
 Unless the method
 set_exception is called, if the invoked method
 has a non-void result type, the method set_result
 must be called exactly once before the DIR returns.
 If the operation has a void result type, the method
 set_result may optionally be
 called once with an Any object whose type is
 tk_void. Calling the method set_result before
 the method arguments has been called or after
 the method set_result or set_exception has been
 called will result in a BAD_INV_ORDER exception. Calling the method
 set_result without having previously called
 the method ctx when the IDL operation contains a
 context expression, or when the NVList passed to arguments did not
 describe all parameters passed by the client, may result in a MARSHAL
 system exception.

Parameters:
any - an Any object containing the return value to be set


"
ServerRequest,set_exception(Any any),void,Throws an org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT exception.,"

set_exception
public void set_exception(Any any)
Throws an org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT exception.
 
 Returns the given exception to the client.  This method
 is invoked by the DIR, which may call it at any time.
 The Any object  passed to this method must
 contain either a system
 exception or one of the user exceptions specified in the
 invoked operation's IDL definition. Passing in an
 Any object that does not contain an exception
 will cause a BAD_PARAM system exception to be thrown. Passing
 in an unlisted user exception will result in either the DIR receiving a
 BAD_PARAM system exception or in the client receiving an
 UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION system exception.

Parameters:
any - the Any object containing the exception
Throws:
BAD_PARAM - if the given Any object does not
                      contain an exception or the exception is an
                      unlisted user exception
UNKNOWN_EXCEPTION - if the given exception is an unlisted
                              user exception and the DIR did not
                              receive a BAD_PARAM exception
