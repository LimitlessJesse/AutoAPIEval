 Accepts decimal, hexadecimal, and octal numbers given by
 the following grammar:

 

DecodableString:
Signopt DecimalNumeral
Signopt 0x HexDigits
Signopt 0X HexDigits
Signopt # HexDigits
Signopt 0 OctalDigits
Sign:
-
+


DecimalNumeral, HexDigits, and OctalDigits
 are as defined in section 3.10.1 of
 The Java™ Language Specification,
 except that underscores are not accepted between digits.

 The sequence of characters following an optional
 sign and/or radix specifier (""0x"", ""0X"",
 ""#"", or leading zero) is parsed as by the Byte.parseByte method with the indicated radix (10, 16, or 8).
 This sequence of characters must represent a positive value or
 a NumberFormatException will be thrown.  The result is
 negated if first character of the specified String is
 the minus sign.  No whitespace characters are permitted in the
 String.

Parameters:
nm - the String to decode.
Returns:
a Byte object holding the byte
          value represented by nm
Throws:
NumberFormatException - if the String does not
            contain a parsable byte.

parseByte
public static byte parseByte(String s)
                      throws NumberFormatException
Parses the string argument as a signed decimal byte. The characters in the string must all be decimal digits,
 except that the first character may be an ASCII minus sign
 '-' ('\u002D') to indicate a negative
 value or an ASCII plus sign '+'
 ('\u002B') to indicate a positive value. The
 resulting byte value is returned, exactly as if the
 argument and the radix 10 were given as arguments to the parseByte(java.lang.String, int) method.

Parameters:
s - a String containing the
                  byte representation to be parsed
Returns:
the byte value represented by the
                  argument in decimal

                             int radix)
                      throws NumberFormatException
Parses the string argument as a signed byte in the
 radix specified by the second argument. The characters in the
 string must all be digits, of the specified radix (as
 determined by whether Character.digit(char,
 int) returns a nonnegative value) except that the first
 character may be an ASCII minus sign '-'
 ('\u002D') to indicate a negative value or an
 ASCII plus sign '+' ('\u002B') to
 indicate a positive value.  The resulting byte value is
 returned.

 An exception of type NumberFormatException is
 thrown if any of the following situations occurs:
 
 The first argument is null or is a string of
 length zero.

  The radix is either smaller than Character.MIN_RADIX or larger than Character.MAX_RADIX.

  Any character of the string is not a digit of the
 specified radix, except that the first character may be a minus
 sign '-' ('\u002D') or plus sign
 '+' ('\u002B') provided that the
 string is longer than length 1.

  The value represented by the string is not a value of type
 byte.
 

Parameters:
s - the String containing the
                  byte
                  representation to be parsed
radix - the radix to be used while parsing s
Returns:
the byte value represented by the string
                   argument in the specified radix
Throws:
NumberFormatException - If the string does
                  not contain a parsable byte.

5,Class,2,Class<?>[] getInterfaces(),True,Determines the interfaces implemented by the class or interface represented by this object.,"

getInterfaces
public Class<?>[] getInterfaces()
Determines the interfaces implemented by the class or interface
 represented by this object.

  If this object represents a class, the return value is an array
 containing objects representing all interfaces implemented by the
 class. The order of the interface objects in the array corresponds to
 the order of the interface names in the implements clause
 of the declaration of the class represented by this object. For
 example, given the declaration:
 
class Shimmer implements FloorWax, DessertTopping { ... }

 suppose the value of s is an instance of
 Shimmer; the value of the expression:
 
s.getClass().getInterfaces()[0]

 is the Class object that represents interface
 FloorWax; and the value of:
 
s.getClass().getInterfaces()[1]

 is the Class object that represents interface
 DessertTopping.

  If this object represents an interface, the array contains objects
 representing all interfaces extended by the interface. The order of the
 interface objects in the array corresponds to the order of the interface
 names in the extends clause of the declaration of the
 interface represented by this object.

  If this object represents a class or interface that implements no
 interfaces, the method returns an array of length 0.

  If this object represents a primitive type or void, the method
 returns an array of length 0.

  If this Class object represents an array type, the
 interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable are
 returned in that order.

Returns:
an array of interfaces implemented by this class.

getConstructors
public Constructor<?>[] getConstructors()
                                 throws SecurityException
Returns an array containing Constructor objects reflecting
 all the public constructors of the class represented by this
 Class object.  An array of length 0 is returned if the
 class has no public constructors, or if the class is an array class, or
 if the class reflects a primitive type or void.

 Note that while this method returns an array of Constructor<T> objects (that is an array of constructors from
 this class), the return type of this method is Constructor<?>[] and not Constructor<T>[] as
 might be expected.  This less informative return type is
 necessary since after being returned from this method, the
 array could be modified to hold Constructor objects for
 different classes, which would violate the type guarantees of
 Constructor<T>[].

Returns:
the array of Constructor objects representing the
         public constructors of this class
Throws:
SecurityException - If a security manager, s, is present and
         the caller's class loader is not the same as or an

Returns an array containing Method objects reflecting all the
 public methods of the class or interface represented by this Class object, including those declared by the class or interface and
 those inherited from superclasses and superinterfaces.

  If this Class object represents a type that has multiple
 public methods with the same name and parameter types, but different
 return types, then the returned array has a Method object for
 each such method.

  If this Class object represents a type with a class
 initialization method <clinit>, then the returned array does
 not have a corresponding Method object.

  If this Class object represents an array type, then the
 returned array has a Method object for each of the public
 methods inherited by the array type from Object. It does not
 contain a Method object for clone().

  If this Class object represents an interface then the
 returned array does not contain any implicitly declared methods from
 Object. Therefore, if no methods are explicitly declared in
 this interface or any of its superinterfaces then the returned array
 has length 0. (Note that a Class object which represents a class
 always has public methods, inherited from Object.)

  If this Class object represents a primitive type or void,
 then the returned array has length 0.

  Static methods declared in superinterfaces of the class or interface
 represented by this Class object are not considered members of
 the class or interface.

  The elements in the returned array are not sorted and are not in any
 particular order.

Returns:

  If this Class object represents a class or interface with no
 no accessible public fields, then this method returns an array of length
 0.

  If this Class object represents a class, then this method
 returns the public fields of the class and of all its superclasses.

  If this Class object represents an interface, then this
 method returns the fields of the interface and of all its

"
6,ClassLoader,1,ClassLoader getParent(),True,Returns the parent class loader for delegation.,"

getParent
public final ClassLoader getParent()
Returns the parent class loader for delegation. Some implementations may
 use null to represent the bootstrap class loader. This method
 will return null in such implementations if this class loader's
 parent is the bootstrap class loader.

  If a security manager is present, and the invoker's class loader is
 not null and is not an ancestor of this class loader, then this
 method invokes the security manager's checkPermission method with a RuntimePermission(""getClassLoader"") permission to verify
 access to the parent class loader is permitted.  If not, a
 SecurityException will be thrown.  

Returns:
The parent ClassLoader
Throws:
SecurityException - If a security manager exists and its checkPermission
          method doesn't allow access to this class loader's parent class
          loader.

"
6,ClassLoader,2,ClassLoader getSystemClassLoader(),True,Returns the system class loader for delegation.,"

getSystemClassLoader
public static ClassLoader getSystemClassLoader()
Returns the system class loader for delegation.  This is the default
 delegation parent for new ClassLoader instances, and is
 typically the class loader used to start the application.

  This method is first invoked early in the runtime's startup
 sequence, at which point it creates the system class loader and sets it
 as the context class loader of the invoking Thread.

  The default system class loader is an implementation-dependent
 instance of this class.

  If the system property ""java.system.class.loader"" is defined
 when this method is first invoked then the value of that property is
 taken to be the name of a class that will be returned as the system
 class loader.  The class is loaded using the default system class loader
 and must define a public constructor that takes a single parameter of
 type ClassLoader which is used as the delegation parent.  An
 instance is then created using this constructor with the default system
 class loader as the parameter.  The resulting class loader is defined
 to be the system class loader.

  If a security manager is present, and the invoker's class loader is
 not null and the invoker's class loader is not the same as or
 an ancestor of the system class loader, then this method invokes the
 security manager's checkPermission method with a RuntimePermission(""getClassLoader"") permission to verify
 access to the system class loader.  If not, a
 SecurityException will be thrown.  

Returns:
The system ClassLoader for delegation, or
          null if none
Throws:
SecurityException - If a security manager exists and its checkPermission
          method doesn't allow access to the system class loader.
IllegalStateException - If invoked recursively during the construction of the class
          loader specified by the ""java.system.class.loader""
          property.
Error - If the system property ""java.system.class.loader""
          is defined but the named class could not be loaded, the
          provider class does not define the required constructor, or an
          exception is thrown by that constructor when it is invoked. The
          underlying cause of the error can be retrieved via the
          Throwable.getCause() method.

loadClass
public Class<?> loadClass(String name)

Loads the class with the specified binary name.
 This method searches for classes in the same manner as the loadClass(String, boolean) method.  It is invoked by the Java virtual
 machine to resolve class references.  Invoking this method is equivalent
 to invoking loadClass(name,
 false).

Parameters:
name - The binary name of the class
Returns:

                             boolean resolve)
                      throws ClassNotFoundException
Loads the class with the specified binary name.  The
 default implementation of this method searches for classes in the
 following order:

 
 Invoke findLoadedClass(String) to check if the class
   has already been loaded.  
 Invoke the loadClass method
   on the parent class loader.  If the parent is null the class
   loader built-in to the virtual machine is used, instead.  
 Invoke the findClass(String) method to find the
   class.  

 If the class was found using the above steps, and the
 resolve flag is true, this method will then invoke the resolveClass(Class) method on the resulting Class object.

  Subclasses of ClassLoader are encouraged to override findClass(String), rather than this method.  
 Unless overridden, this method synchronizes on the result of
 getClassLoadingLock method
 during the entire class loading process.

Parameters:
name - The binary name of the class
resolve - If true then resolve the class
Returns:
The resulting Class object
Throws:

11,Float,1,float floatToRawIntBits(float value),False,,NULL
11,Float,2,float intBitsToFloat(int bits),True,Returns the float value corresponding to a given bit representation.,"

intBitsToFloat
public static float intBitsToFloat(int bits)
Returns the float value corresponding to a given
 bit representation.
 The argument is considered to be a representation of a
 floating-point value according to the IEEE 754 floating-point
 ""single format"" bit layout.

 If the argument is 0x7f800000, the result is positive
 infinity.

 If the argument is 0xff800000, the result is negative
 infinity.

 If the argument is any value in the range
 0x7f800001 through 0x7fffffff or in
 the range 0xff800001 through
 0xffffffff, the result is a NaN.  No IEEE 754
 floating-point operation provided by Java can distinguish
 between two NaN values of the same type with different bit
 patterns.  Distinct values of NaN are only distinguishable by
 use of the Float.floatToRawIntBits method.

 In all other cases, let s, e, and m be three
 values that can be computed from the argument:

 
 int s = ((bits >> 31) == 0) ? 1 : -1;
 int e = ((bits >> 23) & 0xff);
 int m = (e == 0) ?
                 (bits & 0x7fffff) << 1 :
                 (bits & 0x7fffff) | 0x800000;
 

 Then the floating-point result equals the value of the mathematical
 expression s·m·2e-150.

 Note that this method may not be able to return a
 float NaN with exactly same bit pattern as the
 int argument.  IEEE 754 distinguishes between two
 kinds of NaNs, quiet NaNs and signaling NaNs.  The
 differences between the two kinds of NaN are generally not
 visible in Java.  Arithmetic operations on signaling NaNs turn
 them into quiet NaNs with a different, but often similar, bit
 pattern.  However, on some processors merely copying a
 signaling NaN also performs that conversion.  In particular,
 copying a signaling NaN to return it to the calling method may
 perform this conversion.  So intBitsToFloat may
 not be able to return a float with a signaling NaN
 bit pattern.  Consequently, for some int values,
 floatToRawIntBits(intBitsToFloat(start)) may
 not equal start.  Moreover, which
 particular bit patterns represent signaling NaNs is platform
 dependent; although all NaN bit patterns, quiet or signaling,
 must be in the NaN range identified above.

Parameters:
bits - an integer.
Returns:
the float floating-point value with the same bit
          pattern.

 The Java™ Language Specification,
 except that underscores are not accepted between digits.

 The sequence of characters following an optional
 sign and/or radix specifier (""0x"", ""0X"",
 ""#"", or leading zero) is parsed as by the Long.parseLong method with the indicated radix (10, 16, or 8).
 This sequence of characters must represent a positive value or
 a NumberFormatException will be thrown.  The result is
 negated if first character of the specified String is
 the minus sign.  No whitespace characters are permitted in the
 String.

Parameters:
nm - the String to decode.
Returns:
a Long object holding the long
            value represented by nm
Throws:

public static double pow(double a,
                         double b)
Returns the value of the first argument raised to the power of the
 second argument. Special cases:

 If the second argument is positive or negative zero, then the
 result is 1.0.
 If the second argument is 1.0, then the result is the same as the
 first argument.
 If the second argument is NaN, then the result is NaN.
 If the first argument is NaN and the second argument is nonzero,
 then the result is NaN.

 If
 
the absolute value of the first argument is greater than 1
 and the second argument is positive infinity, or
 the absolute value of the first argument is less than 1 and
 the second argument is negative infinity,
 
 then the result is positive infinity.

 If
 
the absolute value of the first argument is greater than 1 and
 the second argument is negative infinity, or
 the absolute value of the
 first argument is less than 1 and the second argument is positive
 infinity,
 
 then the result is positive zero.

 second argument is infinite, then the result is NaN.

 If
 
the first argument is positive zero and the second argument
 is greater than zero, or

 argument is less than zero,
 
 then the result is positive zero.

 If
 
the first argument is positive zero and the second argument
 is less than zero, or
 the first argument is positive infinity and the second
 argument is greater than zero,
 
 then the result is positive infinity.

 If
 
the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
 is greater than zero but not a finite odd integer, or
 the first argument is negative infinity and the second
 argument is less than zero but not a finite odd integer,
 
 then the result is positive zero.

 If
 
the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
 is a positive finite odd integer, or
 the first argument is negative infinity and the second
 argument is a negative finite odd integer,
 
 then the result is negative zero.

 If
 
the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
 is less than zero but not a finite odd integer, or
 the first argument is negative infinity and the second
 argument is greater than zero but not a finite odd integer,
 
 then the result is positive infinity.

 If
 
the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
 is a negative finite odd integer, or
 the first argument is negative infinity and the second
 argument is a positive finite odd integer,
 
 then the result is negative infinity.

 If the first argument is finite and less than zero
 
 if the second argument is a finite even integer, the
 result is equal to the result of raising the absolute value of
 the first argument to the power of the second argument

 if the second argument is a finite odd integer, the result
 is equal to the negative of the result of raising the absolute
 value of the first argument to the power of the second
 argument

 if the second argument is finite and not an integer, then
 the result is NaN.
 
If both arguments are integers, then the result is exactly equal
 to the mathematical result of raising the first argument to the power
 of the second argument if that result can in fact be represented
 exactly as a double value.
(In the foregoing descriptions, a floating-point value is
 considered to be an integer if and only if it is finite and a
 fixed point of the method ceil or,
 equivalently, a fixed point of the method floor. A value is a fixed point of a one-argument
 method if and only if the result of applying the method to the
 value is equal to the value.)

 The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result.
 Results must be semi-monotonic.

Parameters:
a - the base.
b - the exponent.
Returns:

"
15,Math,7,double random(),True,"Returns a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.","

random
public static double random()
Returns a double value with a positive sign, greater
 than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.
 Returned values are chosen pseudorandomly with (approximately)
 uniform distribution from that range.

 When this method is first called, it creates a single new
 pseudorandom-number generator, exactly as if by the expression

 new java.util.Random()

 This new pseudorandom-number generator is used thereafter for
 all calls to this method and is used nowhere else.

 This method is properly synchronized to allow correct use by
 more than one thread. However, if many threads need to generate
 pseudorandom numbers at a great rate, it may reduce contention
 for each thread to have its own pseudorandom-number generator.

Returns:
a pseudorandom double greater than or equal
 to 0.0 and less than 1.0.

17,Object,3,boolean equals(Object obj),True,"Indicates whether some other object is ""equal to"" this one.","

equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Indicates whether some other object is ""equal to"" this one.
 
 The equals method implements an equivalence relation
 on non-null object references:
 
It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value
     x, x.equals(x) should return
     true.
 It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values
     x and y, x.equals(y)
     should return true if and only if
     y.equals(x) returns true.
 It is transitive: for any non-null reference values
     x, y, and z, if
     x.equals(y) returns true and
     y.equals(z) returns true, then
     x.equals(z) should return true.
 It is consistent: for any non-null reference values
     x and y, multiple invocations of
     x.equals(y) consistently return true
     or consistently return false, provided no
     information used in equals comparisons on the
     objects is modified.
 For any non-null reference value x,
     x.equals(null) should return false.
 

 The equals method for class Object implements
 the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
 that is, for any non-null reference values x and
 y, this method returns true if and only
 if x and y refer to the same object
 (x == y has the value true).
 
 Note that it is generally necessary to override the hashCode
 method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
 general contract for the hashCode method, which states
 that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

Parameters:
obj - the reference object with which to compare.
Returns:
true if this object is the same as the obj
          argument; false otherwise.

 The toString method for class Object
 returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the
 object is an instance, the at-sign character `@', and
 the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the
 object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the
 value of:

22,Runtime,9,void addShutdownHook(Thread hook),True,Registers a new virtual-machine shutdown hook.,"

addShutdownHook
public void addShutdownHook(Thread hook)
Registers a new virtual-machine shutdown hook.

  The Java virtual machine shuts down in response to two kinds
 of events:

   
 The program exits normally, when the last non-daemon
   thread exits or when the exit (equivalently,
   System.exit) method is invoked, or

    The virtual machine is terminated in response to a
   user interrupt, such as typing ^C, or a system-wide event,
   such as user logoff or system shutdown.

   
 A shutdown hook is simply an initialized but unstarted
 thread.  When the virtual machine begins its shutdown sequence it will
 start all registered shutdown hooks in some unspecified order and let
 them run concurrently.  When all the hooks have finished it will then
 halt. Note that daemon threads will continue to run during the shutdown
 sequence, as will non-daemon threads if shutdown was initiated by
 invoking the exit method.

  Once the shutdown sequence has begun it can be stopped only by
 invoking the halt method, which forcibly
 terminates the virtual machine.

  Once the shutdown sequence has begun it is impossible to register a
 new shutdown hook or de-register a previously-registered hook.
 Attempting either of these operations will cause an
 IllegalStateException to be thrown.

  Shutdown hooks run at a delicate time in the life cycle of a virtual
 machine and should therefore be coded defensively.  They should, in
 particular, be written to be thread-safe and to avoid deadlocks insofar
 as possible.  They should also not rely blindly upon services that may
 have registered their own shutdown hooks and therefore may themselves in
 the process of shutting down.  Attempts to use other thread-based
 services such as the AWT event-dispatch thread, for example, may lead to
 deadlocks.

  Shutdown hooks should also finish their work quickly.  When a
 program invokes exit the expectation is
 that the virtual machine will promptly shut down and exit.  When the
 virtual machine is terminated due to user logoff or system shutdown the
 underlying operating system may only allow a fixed amount of time in
 which to shut down and exit.  It is therefore inadvisable to attempt any
 user interaction or to perform a long-running computation in a shutdown
 hook.

  Uncaught exceptions are handled in shutdown hooks just as in any
 other thread, by invoking the
 uncaughtException method of the
 thread's ThreadGroup object. The default implementation of this
 method prints the exception's stack trace to System.err and
 terminates the thread; it does not cause the virtual machine to exit or
 halt.

  In rare circumstances the virtual machine may abort, that is,
 stop running without shutting down cleanly.  This occurs when the
 virtual machine is terminated externally, for example with the
 SIGKILL signal on Unix or the TerminateProcess call on
 Microsoft Windows.  The virtual machine may also abort if a native
 method goes awry by, for example, corrupting internal data structures or
 attempting to access nonexistent memory.  If the virtual machine aborts
 then no guarantee can be made about whether or not any shutdown hooks
 will be run.

Parameters:
hook - An initialized but unstarted Thread object
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - If the specified hook has already been registered,
          or if it can be determined that the hook is already running or
          has already been run
IllegalStateException - If the virtual machine is already in the process
          of shutting down
SecurityException - If a security manager is present and it denies
          RuntimePermission(""shutdownHooks"")

"
22,Runtime,10,void exit(int status),True,Terminates the currently running Java virtual machine by initiating its shutdown sequence.,"

exit
public void exit(int status)
Terminates the currently running Java virtual machine by initiating its
 shutdown sequence.  This method never returns normally.  The argument
 serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status code indicates
 abnormal termination.

  All registered shutdown hooks, if any,
 are started in some unspecified order and allowed to run concurrently
 until they finish.  Once this is done the virtual machine
 halts.

  If this method is invoked after all shutdown hooks have already
 been run and the status is nonzero then this method halts the
 virtual machine with the given status code. Otherwise, this method
 blocks indefinitely.

  The System.exit method is the
 conventional and convenient means of invoking this method.

Parameters:
status - Termination status.  By convention, a nonzero status code
         indicates abnormal termination.
Throws:
SecurityException - If a security manager is present and its
         checkExit method does not permit
         exiting with the specified status

"
22,Runtime,11,void gc(),True,Runs the garbage collector.,"

gc
public void gc()
Runs the garbage collector.
 Calling this method suggests that the Java virtual machine expend
 effort toward recycling unused objects in order to make the memory
 they currently occupy available for quick reuse. When control
 returns from the method call, the virtual machine has made
 its best effort to recycle all discarded objects.
 
 The name gc stands for ""garbage
 collector"". The virtual machine performs this recycling
 process automatically as needed, in a separate thread, even if the
 gc method is not invoked explicitly.
 
 The method System.gc() is the conventional and convenient
 means of invoking this method.

"
22,Runtime,12,long totalMemory(),True,Returns the total amount of memory in the Java virtual machine.,"

totalMemory
public long totalMemory()
Returns the total amount of memory in the Java virtual machine.
 The value returned by this method may vary over time, depending on
 the host environment.
 
 Note that the amount of memory required to hold an object of any
 given type may be implementation-dependent.

Returns:
the total amount of memory currently available for current
          and future objects, measured in bytes.


"
22,Runtime,13,long freeMemory(),True,Returns the amount of free memory in the Java Virtual Machine.,"

freeMemory

 by freeMemory.

Returns:
an approximation to the total amount of memory currently
          available for future allocated objects, measured in bytes.


"
22,Runtime,14,long maxMemory(),True,Returns the maximum amount of memory that the Java virtual machine will attempt to use.,"

maxMemory
public long maxMemory()

          attempt to use, measured in bytes

"
22,Runtime,15,int availableProcessors(),True,Returns the number of processors available to the Java virtual machine.,"

availableProcessors
public int availableProcessors()
Returns the number of processors available to the Java virtual machine.

 machine.  Applications that are sensitive to the number of available
 processors should therefore occasionally poll this property and adjust
 their resource usage appropriately. 

Returns:
the maximum number of processors available to the virtual
          machine; never smaller than one

 is a negative finite odd integer, or
 the first argument is negative infinity and the second
 argument is a positive finite odd integer,

 if the second argument is a finite even integer, the
 result is equal to the result of raising the absolute value of
 the first argument to the power of the second argument

 if the second argument is a finite odd integer, the result
 is equal to the negative of the result of raising the absolute
 value of the first argument to the power of the second
 argument

 the result is NaN.
 
If both arguments are integers, then the result is exactly equal
 to the mathematical result of raising the first argument to the power
 of the second argument if that result can in fact be represented
 exactly as a double value.

 considered to be an integer if and only if it is finite and a
 fixed point of the method ceil or,
 equivalently, a fixed point of the method floor. A value is a fixed point of a one-argument
 method if and only if the result of applying the method to the
 value is equal to the value.)

random
public static double random()
Returns a double value with a positive sign, greater
 than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0.
 Returned values are chosen pseudorandomly with (approximately)
 uniform distribution from that range.

 When this method is first called, it creates a single new
 pseudorandom-number generator, exactly as if by the expression

 new java.util.Random()

 This new pseudorandom-number generator is used thereafter for
 all calls to this method and is used nowhere else.

 This method is properly synchronized to allow correct use by
 more than one thread. However, if many threads need to generate
 pseudorandom numbers at a great rate, it may reduce contention
 for each thread to have its own pseudorandom-number generator.

Returns:
a pseudorandom double greater than or equal
 to 0.0 and less than 1.0.

toLowerCase
public String toLowerCase()
Converts all of the characters in this String to lower
 case using the rules of the default locale. This is equivalent to calling
 toLowerCase(Locale.getDefault()).
 
Note: This method is locale sensitive, and may produce unexpected
 results if used for strings that are intended to be interpreted locale

 toUpperCase(Locale.getDefault()).
 
Note: This method is locale sensitive, and may produce unexpected
 results if used for strings that are intended to be interpreted locale
 independently.
 Examples are programming language identifiers, protocol keys, and HTML
 tags.
 For instance, ""title"".toUpperCase() in a Turkish locale
 returns ""T\u0130TLE"", where '\u0130' is the
 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER I WITH DOT ABOVE character.
 To obtain correct results for locale insensitive strings, use

 There is no restriction on the value of fromIndex. If it
 is negative, it has the same effect as if it were zero: this entire
 string may be searched. If it is greater than the length of this
 string, it has the same effect as if it were equal to the length of
 this string: -1 is returned.

 All indices are specified in char values
 (Unicode code units).

Parameters:

 the specified character. For values of ch in the
 range from 0 to 0xFFFF (inclusive), the index (in Unicode code
 units) returned is the largest value k such that:
 
 this.charAt(k) == ch
 
 is true. For other values of ch, it is the
 largest value k such that:
 
 this.codePointAt(k) == ch
 
 is true.  In either case, if no such character occurs in this
 string, then -1 is returned.  The
 String is searched backwards starting at the last
 character.

Parameters:
ch - a character (Unicode code point).
Returns:
the index of the last occurrence of the character in the
          character sequence represented by this object, or
          -1 if the character does not occur.

lastIndexOf
public int lastIndexOf(int ch,
                       int fromIndex)
Returns the index within this string of the last occurrence of
 the specified character, searching backward starting at the
 specified index. For values of ch in the range
 from 0 to 0xFFFF (inclusive), the index returned is the largest
 value k such that:
 
 (this.charAt(k) == ch)  && (k <= fromIndex)
 
 is true. For other values of ch, it is the
 largest value k such that:
 
 (this.codePointAt(k) == ch)  && (k <= fromIndex)
 
 is true. In either case, if no such character occurs in this
 string at or before position fromIndex, then
 -1 is returned.

 All indices are specified in char values
 (Unicode code units).

Parameters:
ch - a character (Unicode code point).
fromIndex - the index to start the search from. There is no
          restriction on the value of fromIndex. If it is
          greater than or equal to the length of this string, it has
          the same effect as if it were equal to one less than the
          length of this string: this entire string may be searched.
          If it is negative, it has the same effect as if it were -1:
          -1 is returned.
Returns:
the index of the last occurrence of the character in the
          character sequence represented by this object that is less
          than or equal to fromIndex, or -1
          if the character does not occur before that point.

replaceAll
public String replaceAll(String regex,
                         String replacement)
Replaces each substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the
 given replacement.

  An invocation of this method of the form
 str.replaceAll(regex, repl)
 yields exactly the same result as the expression

 

Pattern.compile(regex).matcher(str).replaceAll(repl)
 


 Note that backslashes (\) and dollar signs ($) in the
 replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it were
 being treated as a literal replacement string; see
 Matcher.replaceAll.
 Use Matcher.quoteReplacement(java.lang.String) to suppress the special
 meaning of these characters, if desired.

Parameters:
regex - the regular expression to which this string is to be matched
replacement - the string to be substituted for each match
Returns:
The resulting String

28,String,20,String[] split(String regex),True,Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression.,"

split
public String[] split(String regex)
Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression.

  This method works as if by invoking the two-argument split method with the given expression and a limit
 argument of zero.  Trailing empty strings are therefore not included in
 the resulting array.

  The string ""boo:and:foo"", for example, yields the following
 results with these expressions:

concat
public String concat(String str)
Concatenates the specified string to the end of this string.
 
 If the length of the argument string is 0, then this
 String object is returned. Otherwise, a
 String object is returned that represents a character
 sequence that is the concatenation of the character sequence
 represented by this String object and the character
 sequence represented by the argument string.
 Examples:
 
 ""cares"".concat(""s"") returns ""caress""
 ""to"".concat(""get"").concat(""her"") returns ""together""
 

Parameters:
str - the String that is concatenated to the end
                of this String.
Returns:
a string that represents the concatenation of this object's
          characters followed by the string argument's characters.

"
28,String,23,String intern(),True,Returns a canonical representation for the string object.,"

intern
public String intern()
Returns a canonical representation for the string object.
 
 A pool of strings, initially empty, is maintained privately by the
 class String.
 
 When the intern method is invoked, if the pool already contains a
 string equal to this String object as determined by
 the equals(Object) method, then the string from the pool is
 returned. Otherwise, this String object is added to the
 pool and a reference to this String object is returned.
 
 It follows that for any two strings s and t,
 s.intern() == t.intern() is true
 if and only if s.equals(t) is true.
 
 All literal strings and string-valued constant expressions are
 interned. String literals are defined in section 3.10.5 of the
 The Java™ Language Specification.

Returns:
a string that has the same contents as this string, but is
          guaranteed to be from a pool of unique strings.

         limited by the maximum dimension of a Java array as defined by
         The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification.
         The behaviour on a
         null argument depends on the conversion.
Returns:
A formatted string
Throws:
IllegalFormatException - If a format string contains an illegal syntax, a format
          specifier that is incompatible with the given arguments,
          insufficient arguments given the format string, or other

"
29,StringBuffer,7,StringBuffer reverse(),True,Causes this character sequence to be replaced by the reverse of the sequence.,"

reverse
public StringBuffer reverse()
Causes this character sequence to be replaced by the reverse of
 the sequence. If there are any surrogate pairs included in the
 sequence, these are treated as single characters for the
 reverse operation. Thus, the order of the high-low surrogates
 is never reversed.

 Let n be the character length of this character sequence
 (not the length in char values) just prior to
 execution of the reverse method. Then the
 character at index k in the new character sequence is
 equal to the character at index n-k-1 in the old
 character sequence.

 Note that the reverse operation may result in producing
 surrogate pairs that were unpaired low-surrogates and
 high-surrogates before the operation. For example, reversing
 ""\uDC00\uD800"" produces ""\uD800\uDC00"" which is
 a valid surrogate pair.

30,StringBuilder,14,void ensureCapacity(int minimumCapacity),True,Ensures that the capacity is at least equal to the specified minimum.,"

ensureCapacity
public void ensureCapacity(int minimumCapacity)
Ensures that the capacity is at least equal to the specified minimum.
 If the current capacity is less than the argument, then a new internal
 array is allocated with greater capacity. The new capacity is the
 larger of:
 
The minimumCapacity argument.
 Twice the old capacity, plus 2.
 
 If the minimumCapacity argument is nonpositive, this
 method takes no action and simply returns.
 Note that subsequent operations on this object can reduce the
 actual capacity below that requested here.

Parameters:
minimumCapacity - the minimum desired capacity.


"
30,StringBuilder,15,void trimToSize(),True,Attempts to reduce storage used for the character sequence.,"

trimToSize
public void trimToSize()
Attempts to reduce storage used for the character sequence.
 If the buffer is larger than necessary to hold its current sequence of
 characters, then it may be resized to become more space efficient.
 Calling this method may, but is not required to, affect the value
 returned by a subsequent call to the capacity() method.

"
31,System,1,long currentTimeMillis(),True,Returns the current time in milliseconds.,"

currentTimeMillis
public static long currentTimeMillis()
Returns the current time in milliseconds.  Note that
 while the unit of time of the return value is a millisecond,
 the granularity of the value depends on the underlying
 operating system and may be larger.  For example, many
 operating systems measure time in units of tens of
 milliseconds.

  See the description of the class Date for
 a discussion of slight discrepancies that may arise between
 ""computer time"" and coordinated universal time (UTC).

Returns:
the difference, measured in milliseconds, between
          the current time and midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC.

"
31,System,2,"void arraycopy(Object src, int srcPos, Object dest, int destPos, int length)",True,"Copies an array from the specified source array, beginning at the specified position, to the specified position of the destination array.","

arraycopy
public static void arraycopy(Object src,
                             int srcPos,
                             Object dest,
                             int destPos,
                             int length)
Copies an array from the specified source array, beginning at the
 specified position, to the specified position of the destination array.
 A subsequence of array components are copied from the source
 array referenced by src to the destination array
 referenced by dest. The number of components copied is
 equal to the length argument. The components at
 positions srcPos through
 srcPos+length-1 in the source array are copied into
 positions destPos through
 destPos+length-1, respectively, of the destination
 array.
 
 If the src and dest arguments refer to the
 same array object, then the copying is performed as if the
 components at positions srcPos through
 srcPos+length-1 were first copied to a temporary
 array with length components and then the contents of
 the temporary array were copied into positions
 destPos through destPos+length-1 of the
 destination array.
 
 If dest is null, then a
 NullPointerException is thrown.
 
 If src is null, then a
 NullPointerException is thrown and the destination
 array is not modified.
 
 Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an
 ArrayStoreException is thrown and the destination is
 not modified:
 
The src argument refers to an object that is not an
     array.
 The dest argument refers to an object that is not an
     array.
 The src argument and dest argument refer
     to arrays whose component types are different primitive types.
 The src argument refers to an array with a primitive
    component type and the dest argument refers to an array
     with a reference component type.
 The src argument refers to an array with a reference
    component type and the dest argument refers to an array
     with a primitive component type.
 

 Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an
 IndexOutOfBoundsException is
 thrown and the destination is not modified:
 
The srcPos argument is negative.
 The destPos argument is negative.
 The length argument is negative.
 srcPos+length is greater than
     src.length, the length of the source array.
 destPos+length is greater than
     dest.length, the length of the destination array.
 

 Otherwise, if any actual component of the source array from
 position srcPos through
 srcPos+length-1 cannot be converted to the component
 type of the destination array by assignment conversion, an
 ArrayStoreException is thrown. In this case, let
 k be the smallest nonnegative integer less than
 length such that src[srcPos+k]
 cannot be converted to the component type of the destination
 array; when the exception is thrown, source array components from
 positions srcPos through
 srcPos+k-1
 will already have been copied to destination array positions
 destPos through
 destPos+k-1 and no other
 positions of the destination array will have been modified.
 (Because of the restrictions already itemized, this
 paragraph effectively applies only to the situation where both
 arrays have component types that are reference types.)

Parameters:
src - the source array.
srcPos - starting position in the source array.
dest - the destination array.
destPos - starting position in the destination data.
length - the number of array elements to be copied.
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException - if copying would cause
               access of data outside array bounds.
ArrayStoreException - if an element in the src
               array could not be stored into the dest array
               because of a type mismatch.
NullPointerException - if either src or
               dest is null.


"
31,System,3,void gc(),True,Runs the garbage collector.,"

gc
public static void gc()
Runs the garbage collector.
 
 Calling the gc method suggests that the Java Virtual
 Machine expend effort toward recycling unused objects in order to
 make the memory they currently occupy available for quick reuse.
 When control returns from the method call, the Java Virtual
 Machine has made a best effort to reclaim space from all discarded
 objects.
 
 The call System.gc() is effectively equivalent to the
 call:
 
 Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
 

See Also:
Runtime.gc()


"
31,System,4,void exit(int status),True,Terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine.,"

exit
public static void exit(int status)
Terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine. The
 argument serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status
 code indicates abnormal termination.
 
 This method calls the exit method in class
 Runtime. This method never returns normally.
 
 The call System.exit(n) is effectively equivalent to
 the call:
 
 Runtime.getRuntime().exit(n)
 

Parameters:
status - exit status.
Throws:
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and its checkExit
        method doesn't allow exit with the specified status.
See Also:
Runtime.exit(int)


"
31,System,5,void setOut(PrintStream out),True,"Reassigns the ""standard"" output stream.","

setOut
public static void setOut(PrintStream out)
Reassigns the ""standard"" output stream.

 First, if there is a security manager, its checkPermission
 method is called with a RuntimePermission(""setIO"") permission
  to see if it's ok to reassign the ""standard"" output stream.

Parameters:
out - the new standard output stream
Throws:
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and its
        checkPermission method doesn't allow
        reassigning of the standard output stream.

"
32,Thread,1,void start(),True,Causes this thread to begin execution; the Java Virtual Machine calls the run method of this thread.,"

start
public void start()
Causes this thread to begin execution; the Java Virtual Machine
 calls the run method of this thread.
 
 The result is that two threads are running concurrently: the
 current thread (which returns from the call to the
 start method) and the other thread (which executes its
 run method).
 
 It is never legal to start a thread more than once.
 In particular, a thread may not be restarted once it has completed
 execution.

Throws:
IllegalThreadStateException - if the thread was already
               started.

Waits for this thread to die.

  An invocation of this method behaves in exactly the same
 way as the invocation

 
join(0)


Throws:
InterruptedException - if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
          interrupted status of the current thread is
          cleared when this exception is thrown.


"
32,Thread,4,void interrupt(),True,Interrupts this thread.,"

interrupt
public void interrupt()
Interrupts this thread.

  Unless the current thread is interrupting itself, which is
 always permitted, the checkAccess method
 of this thread is invoked, which may cause a SecurityException to be thrown.

  If this thread is blocked in an invocation of the wait(), wait(long), or wait(long, int) methods of the Object
 class, or of the join(), join(long), join(long, int), sleep(long), or sleep(long, int),
 methods of this class, then its interrupt status will be cleared and it
 will receive an InterruptedException.

  If this thread is blocked in an I/O operation upon an InterruptibleChannel
 then the channel will be closed, the thread's interrupt
 status will be set, and the thread will receive a ClosedByInterruptException.

  If this thread is blocked in a Selector
 then the thread's interrupt status will be set and it will return
 immediately from the selection operation, possibly with a non-zero
 value, just as if the selector's wakeup method were invoked.

  If none of the previous conditions hold then this thread's interrupt
 status will be set. 
 Interrupting a thread that is not alive need not have any effect.

Throws:
SecurityException - if the current thread cannot modify this thread

 does not lose ownership of any monitors.

Parameters:
millis - the length of time to sleep in milliseconds
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the value of millis is negative
InterruptedException - if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
          interrupted status of the current thread is
          cleared when this exception is thrown.

uncaughtException
public void uncaughtException(Thread t,

Called by the Java Virtual Machine when a thread in this
 thread group stops because of an uncaught exception, and the thread
 does not have a specific Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler
 installed.
 
 The uncaughtException method of
 ThreadGroup does the following:
 
If this thread group has a parent thread group, the
     uncaughtException method of that parent is called
     with the same two arguments.
 Otherwise, this method checks to see if there is a
     default
     uncaught exception handler installed, and if so, its
     uncaughtException method is called with the same
     two arguments.
 Otherwise, this method determines if the Throwable
     argument is an instance of ThreadDeath. If so, nothing
     special is done. Otherwise, a message containing the
     thread's name, as returned from the thread's getName method, and a stack backtrace,
     using the Throwable's printStackTrace method, is
     printed to the standard error stream.
 

 Applications can override this method in subclasses of
 ThreadGroup to provide alternative handling of
 uncaught exceptions.

Specified by:
uncaughtException in interface Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler
Parameters:
t - the thread that is about to exit.
e - the uncaught exception.

"
33,ThreadGroup,4,void interrupt(),True,Interrupts all threads in this thread group.,"

interrupt
public final void interrupt()
Interrupts all threads in this thread group.
 
 First, the checkAccess method of this thread group is
 called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception.
 
 This method then calls the interrupt method on all the
 threads in this thread group and in all of its subgroups.

Throws:
SecurityException - if the current thread is not allowed

Destroys this thread group and all of its subgroups. This thread
 group must be empty, indicating that all threads that had been in
 this thread group have since stopped.
 
 First, the checkAccess method of this thread group is
 called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception.

Throws:
IllegalThreadStateException - if the thread group is not
               empty or if the thread group has already been destroyed.

set
public void set(T value)
Sets the current thread's copy of this thread-local variable
 to the specified value.  Most subclasses will have no need to
 override this method, relying solely on the initialValue()
 method to set the values of thread-locals.

Parameters:
value - the value to be stored in the current thread's copy of
        this thread-local.


"
34,ThreadLocal,2,T get(),True,Returns the value in the current thread's copy of this thread-local variable.,"

get
public T get()
Returns the value in the current thread's copy of this
 thread-local variable.  If the variable has no value for the
 current thread, it is first initialized to the value returned
 by an invocation of the initialValue() method.

Returns:
the current thread's value of this thread-local


"

remove
public void remove()
Removes the current thread's value for this thread-local

 read by the current thread, its value will be
 reinitialized by invoking its initialValue() method,
 unless its value is set by the current thread
 in the interim.  This may result in multiple invocations of the
 initialValue method in the current thread.

"
35,Throwable,3,void printStackTrace(),True,Prints this throwable and its backtrace to the standard error stream.,"

printStackTrace
public void printStackTrace()
Prints this throwable and its backtrace to the
 standard error stream. This method prints a stack trace for this
 Throwable object on the error output stream that is
 the value of the field System.err. The first line of
 output contains the result of the toString() method for
 this object.  Remaining lines represent data previously recorded by
 the method fillInStackTrace(). The format of this
 information depends on the implementation, but the following
 example may be regarded as typical:
 
 java.lang.NullPointerException
         at MyClass.mash(MyClass.java:9)
         at MyClass.crunch(MyClass.java:6)
         at MyClass.main(MyClass.java:3)
 
 This example was produced by running the program:
 
 class MyClass {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         crunch(null);
     }
     static void crunch(int[] a) {
         mash(a);
     }
     static void mash(int[] b) {
         System.out.println(b[0]);
     }
 }
 
 The backtrace for a throwable with an initialized, non-null cause
 should generally include the backtrace for the cause.  The format
 of this information depends on the implementation, but the following
 example may be regarded as typical:
 
 HighLevelException: MidLevelException: LowLevelException
         at Junk.a(Junk.java:13)
         at Junk.main(Junk.java:4)
 Caused by: MidLevelException: LowLevelException

         at Junk.d(Junk.java:27)
         at Junk.c(Junk.java:21)
         ... 3 more
 
 Note the presence of lines containing the characters ""..."".
 These lines indicate that the remainder of the stack trace for this
 exception matches the indicated number of frames from the bottom of the
 stack trace of the exception that was caused by this exception (the
 ""enclosing"" exception).  This shorthand can greatly reduce the length
 of the output in the common case where a wrapped exception is thrown
 from same method as the ""causative exception"" is caught.  The above
 example was produced by running the program:
 
 public class Junk {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
         try {
             a();
         } catch(HighLevelException e) {

     }
     static void d() throws LowLevelException {
        e();
     }
     static void e() throws LowLevelException {
         throw new LowLevelException();

     HighLevelException(Throwable cause) { super(cause); }
 }

 class MidLevelException extends Exception {
     MidLevelException(Throwable cause)  { super(cause); }
 }

 class LowLevelException extends Exception {
 }
 
 As of release 7, the platform supports the notion of
 suppressed exceptions (in conjunction with the try-with-resources statement). Any exceptions that were
 suppressed in order to deliver an exception are printed out
 beneath the stack trace.  The format of this information
 depends on the implementation, but the following example may be
 regarded as typical:

 
 Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.Exception: Something happened
  at Foo.bar(Foo.java:10)
  at Foo.main(Foo.java:5)
  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 0
          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
          at Foo.bar(Foo.java:9)
          ... 1 more
 
 Note that the ""... n more"" notation is used on suppressed exceptions
 just at it is used on causes. Unlike causes, suppressed exceptions are
 indented beyond their ""containing exceptions.""

 An exception can have both a cause and one or more suppressed
 exceptions:
 
 Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.Exception: Main block
  at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:7)
  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 2
          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
          at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
          at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
 Caused by: java.lang.Exception: I did it
  at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:8)
 
 Likewise, a suppressed exception can have a cause:
 
 Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.Exception: Main block
  at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:6)
  Suppressed: Resource2$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
          at Resource2.close(Resource2.java:20)
          at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:5)
  Caused by: java.lang.Exception: Rats, you caught me
          at Resource2$CloseFailException.<init>(Resource2.java:45)
