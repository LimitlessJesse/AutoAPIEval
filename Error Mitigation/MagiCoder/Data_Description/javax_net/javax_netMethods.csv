createServerSocket
public ServerSocket createServerSocket()
                                throws IOException
Returns an unbound server socket.  The socket is configured with
 the socket options (such as accept timeout) given to this factory.

Returns:
the unbound socket
Throws:
IOException - if the socket cannot be created

createServerSocket
public abstract ServerSocket createServerSocket(int port)
                                         throws IOException
Returns a server socket bound to the specified port.
 The socket is configured with the socket options
 (such as accept timeout) given to this factory.
 
 If there is a security manager, its checkListen
 method is called with the port argument as its
 argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result
 in a SecurityException.

Parameters:
port - the port to listen to
Returns:
the ServerSocket
Throws:
IOException - for networking errors
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and its
         checkListen method doesn't allow the operation.
IllegalArgumentException - if the port parameter is outside the
         specified range of valid port values, which is between 0 and
         65535, inclusive.

createServerSocket
public abstract ServerSocket createServerSocket(int port,
                                                int backlog)
                                         throws IOException
Returns a server socket bound to the specified port, and uses the
 specified connection backlog.  The socket is configured with
 the socket options (such as accept timeout) given to this factory.
 
 The backlog argument must be a positive
 value greater than 0. If the value passed if equal or less
 than 0, then the default value will be assumed.
 
 If there is a security manager, its checkListen
 method is called with the port argument as its
 argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result
 in a SecurityException.

Parameters:
port - the port to listen to
backlog - how many connections are queued
Returns:
the ServerSocket
Throws:
IOException - for networking errors
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and its
         checkListen method doesn't allow the operation.
IllegalArgumentException - if the port parameter is outside the
         specified range of valid port values, which is between 0 and
         65535, inclusive.

createServerSocket
public abstract ServerSocket createServerSocket(int port,
                                                int backlog,

Returns a server socket bound to the specified port,
 with a specified listen backlog and local IP.
 
 The ifAddress argument can be used on a multi-homed
 host for a ServerSocket that will only accept connect
 requests to one of its addresses. If ifAddress is null,
 it will accept connections on all local addresses. The socket is
 configured with the socket options (such as accept timeout) given
 to this factory.
 
 The backlog argument must be a positive
 value greater than 0. If the value passed if equal or less
 than 0, then the default value will be assumed.
 
 If there is a security manager, its checkListen
 method is called with the port argument as its
 argument to ensure the operation is allowed. This could result
 in a SecurityException.

Parameters:
port - the port to listen to
backlog - how many connections are queued
ifAddress - the network interface address to use
Returns:
the ServerSocket
Throws:
IOException - for networking errors
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and its
         checkListen method doesn't allow the operation.
IllegalArgumentException - if the port parameter is outside the
         specified range of valid port values, which is between 0 and
