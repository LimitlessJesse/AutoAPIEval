newInstance
public static XPathFactory newInstance()
Get a new XPathFactory instance using the default object model,
 DEFAULT_OBJECT_MODEL_URI,
 the W3C DOM.
This method is functionally equivalent to:

   newInstance(DEFAULT_OBJECT_MODEL_URI)
 
Since the implementation for the W3C DOM is always available, this method will never fail.

Returns:
Instance of an XPathFactory.
Throws:
RuntimeException - When there is a failure in creating an
   XPathFactory for the default object model.
