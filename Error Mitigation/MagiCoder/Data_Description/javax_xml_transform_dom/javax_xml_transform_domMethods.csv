ClassName,Method,Return Type,Description,Full Description
DOMResult,getNextSibling(),Node,Get the child node before which the result nodes will be inserted.,"

getNextSibling
public Node getNextSibling()
Get the child node before which the result nodes will be inserted.
If no node was set via
 DOMResult(Node node, Node nextSibling),
 DOMResult(Node node, Node nextSibling, String systemId) or
 setNextSibling(Node nextSibling),
 then null will be returned.

Returns:
The child node before which the result nodes will be inserted.
Since:
1.5


"
DOMResult,getNode(),Node,Get the node that will contain the result DOM tree.,"

getNode
public Node getNode()
Get the node that will contain the result DOM tree.
If no node was set via
 DOMResult(Node node),
 DOMResult(Node node, String systeId),
 DOMResult(Node node, Node nextSibling),
 DOMResult(Node node, Node nextSibling, String systemId) or
 setNode(Node node),
 then the node will be set by the transformation, and may be obtained from this method once the transformation is complete.
 Calling this method before the transformation will return null.

Returns:
The node to which the transformation will be appended.


"
DOMResult,getSystemId(),String,Get the System Identifier.,"

getSystemId
public String getSystemId()
Get the System Identifier.
If no System ID was set via
 DOMResult(Node node, String systemId),
 DOMResult(Node node, Node nextSibling, String systemId) or
 setSystemId(String systemId),
 then null will be returned.

Specified by:
getSystemId in interface Result
Returns:
The system identifier.


"
DOMResult,setNextSibling(Node nextSibling),void,Set the child node before which the result nodes will be inserted.,"

setNextSibling
public void setNextSibling(Node nextSibling)
Set the child node before which the result nodes will be inserted.
Use nextSibling to specify the child node
 before which the result nodes should be inserted.
 If nextSibling is not a descendant of node,
 then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
 If node is null and nextSibling is not null,
 then an IllegalStateException is thrown.
 If nextSibling is null,
 then the behavior is the same as calling DOMResult(Node node),
 i.e. append the result nodes as the last child of the specified node.

Parameters:
nextSibling - The child node before which the result nodes will be inserted.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - If nextSibling is not a
   descendant of node.
IllegalStateException - If node is null
   and nextSibling is not null.
Since:
1.5


"
DOMResult,setNode(Node node),void,Set the node that will contain the result DOM tree.,"

setNode
public void setNode(Node node)
Set the node that will contain the result DOM tree.
In practice, the node should be
 a Document node,
 a DocumentFragment node, or
 a Element node.
 In other words, a node that accepts children.
An IllegalStateException is thrown if
 nextSibling is not null and
 node is not a parent of nextSibling.
 An IllegalStateException is thrown if node is null and
 nextSibling is not null.

Parameters:
node - The node to which the transformation will be appended.
Throws:
IllegalStateException - If nextSibling is not
   null and
   nextSibling is not a child of node or
   node is null and
   nextSibling is not null.


"
DOMResult,setSystemId(String systemId),void,Set the systemId that may be used in association with the node.,"

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(String systemId)
Set the systemId that may be used in association with the node.

Specified by:
setSystemId in interface Result
Parameters:
systemId - The system identifier as a URI string.


"
DOMSource,getNode(),Node,Get the node that represents a Source DOM tree.,"

getNode
public Node getNode()
Get the node that represents a Source DOM tree.

Returns:
The node that is to be transformed.


"
DOMSource,getSystemId(),String,Get the base ID (URL or system ID) from where URLs will be resolved.,"

getSystemId
public String getSystemId()
Get the base ID (URL or system ID) from where URLs
 will be resolved.

Specified by:
getSystemId in interface Source
Returns:
Base URL for this DOM tree.


"
DOMSource,setNode(Node node),void,Set the node that will represents a Source DOM tree.,"

setNode
public void setNode(Node node)
Set the node that will represents a Source DOM tree.

Parameters:
node - The node that is to be transformed.


"
DOMSource,setSystemId(String systemID),void,Set the base ID (URL or system ID) from where URLs will be resolved.,"

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(String systemID)
Set the base ID (URL or system ID) from where URLs
 will be resolved.

Specified by:
setSystemId in interface Source
Parameters:
systemID - Base URL for this DOM tree.
