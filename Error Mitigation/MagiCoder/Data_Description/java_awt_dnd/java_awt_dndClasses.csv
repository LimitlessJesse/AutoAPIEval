ClassName,URL,Description
DnDConstants,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DnDConstants.html,This class contains constant values representing the type of action(s) to be performed by a Drag and Drop operation.
DragGestureEvent,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DragGestureEvent.html,A DragGestureEvent is passed to DragGestureListener's dragGestureRecognized() method when a particular DragGestureRecognizer detects that a platform dependent drag initiating gesture has occurred on the Component that it is tracking.
DragGestureRecognizer,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DragGestureRecognizer.html,The DragGestureRecognizer is an abstract base class for the specification of a platform-dependent listener that can be associated with a particular Component in order to identify platform-dependent drag initiating gestures.
DragSource,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DragSource.html,"The DragSource is the entity responsible for the initiation of the Drag and Drop operation, and may be used in a number of scenarios: 1 default instance per JVM for the lifetime of that JVM."
DragSourceAdapter,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DragSourceAdapter.html,An abstract adapter class for receiving drag source events.
DragSourceContext,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DragSourceContext.html,The DragSourceContext class is responsible for managing the initiator side of the Drag and Drop protocol.
DragSourceDragEvent,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DragSourceDragEvent.html,"The DragSourceDragEvent is delivered from the DragSourceContextPeer, via the DragSourceContext, to the DragSourceListener registered with that DragSourceContext and with its associated DragSource."
DragSourceDropEvent,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DragSourceDropEvent.html,"The DragSourceDropEvent is delivered from the DragSourceContextPeer, via the DragSourceContext, to the dragDropEnd method of DragSourceListeners registered with that DragSourceContext and with its associated DragSource."
DragSourceEvent,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DragSourceEvent.html,This class is the base class for DragSourceDragEvent and DragSourceDropEvent.
DropTarget,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DropTarget.html,The DropTarget is associated with a Component when that Component wishes to accept drops during Drag and Drop operations.
DropTarget.DropTargetAutoScroller,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DropTarget.DropTargetAutoScroller.html,this protected nested class implements autoscrolling
DropTargetAdapter,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DropTargetAdapter.html,An abstract adapter class for receiving drop target events.
DropTargetContext,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DropTargetContext.html,A DropTargetContext is created whenever the logical cursor associated with a Drag and Drop operation coincides with the visible geometry of a Component associated with a DropTarget.
DropTargetDragEvent,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DropTargetDragEvent.html,The DropTargetDragEvent is delivered to a DropTargetListener via its dragEnter() and dragOver() methods.
DropTargetDropEvent,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DropTargetDropEvent.html,The DropTargetDropEvent is delivered via the DropTargetListener drop() method.
DropTargetEvent,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/DropTargetEvent.html,The DropTargetEvent is the base class for both the DropTargetDragEvent and the DropTargetDropEvent.
MouseDragGestureRecognizer,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/dnd/MouseDragGestureRecognizer.html,This abstract subclass of DragGestureRecognizer defines a DragGestureRecognizer for mouse-based gestures.
