SslRMIClientSocketFactory,"createSocket(String host, int port)",Socket,Creates an SSL socket.,"

createSocket
public Socket createSocket(String host,
                           int port)
                    throws IOException
Creates an SSL socket.
If the system property
 javax.rmi.ssl.client.enabledCipherSuites is
 specified, this method will call SSLSocket.setEnabledCipherSuites(String[]) before returning
 the socket. The value of this system property is a string that
 is a comma-separated list of SSL/TLS cipher suites to
 enable.
If the system property
 javax.rmi.ssl.client.enabledProtocols is
 specified, this method will call SSLSocket.setEnabledProtocols(String[]) before returning the
 socket. The value of this system property is a string that is a
 comma-separated list of SSL/TLS protocol versions to
 enable.

Specified by:
createSocket in interface RMIClientSocketFactory
Parameters:
host - the host name
port - the port number
Returns:
a socket connected to the specified host and port.
Throws:
IOException - if an I/O error occurs during socket creation


"
SslRMIClientSocketFactory,equals(Object obj),boolean,"Indicates whether some other object is ""equal to"" this one.","

equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Indicates whether some other object is ""equal to"" this one.
Because all instances of this class are functionally equivalent
 (they all use the default
 SSLSocketFactory), this method simply returns
 this.getClass().equals(obj.getClass()).
A subclass should override this method (as well
 as hashCode()) if its instances are not all
 functionally equivalent.

Overrides:
equals in class Object
Parameters:
obj - the reference object with which to compare.
Returns:
true if this object is the same as the obj
          argument; false otherwise.

Object.hashCode(), 
HashMap


"
SslRMIClientSocketFactory,hashCode(),int,Returns a hash code value for this SslRMIClientSocketFactory.,"

hashCode
public int hashCode()
Returns a hash code value for this
 SslRMIClientSocketFactory.

Overrides:
hashCode in class Object
Returns:
a hash code value for this
 SslRMIClientSocketFactory.
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object), 
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)


"
SslRMIServerSocketFactory,createServerSocket(int port),ServerSocket,Creates a server socket that accepts SSL connections configured according to this factory's SSL socket configuration parameters.,"

createServerSocket
public ServerSocket createServerSocket(int port)
                                throws IOException
Creates a server socket that accepts SSL connections
 configured according to this factory's SSL socket configuration
 parameters.

Specified by:
createServerSocket in interface RMIServerSocketFactory
Parameters:
port - the port number
Returns:
the server socket on the specified port
Throws:
IOException - if an I/O error occurs during server socket
 creation


"
SslRMIServerSocketFactory,equals(Object obj),boolean,"Indicates whether some other object is ""equal to"" this one.","

equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Indicates whether some other object is ""equal to"" this one.
Two SslRMIServerSocketFactory objects are equal
 if they have been constructed with the same SSL context and
 SSL socket configuration parameters.
A subclass should override this method (as well as
 hashCode()) if it adds instance state that affects
 equality.

Overrides:
equals in class Object
Parameters:
obj - the reference object with which to compare.
Returns:
true if this object is the same as the obj
          argument; false otherwise.

Object.hashCode(), 
HashMap

SslRMIServerSocketFactory,getEnabledCipherSuites(),String[],"Returns the names of the cipher suites enabled on SSL connections accepted by server sockets created by this factory, or null if this factory uses the cipher suites that are enabled by default.","

getEnabledCipherSuites
public final String[] getEnabledCipherSuites()
Returns the names of the cipher suites enabled on SSL
 connections accepted by server sockets created by this factory,
 or null if this factory uses the cipher suites
 that are enabled by default.

Returns:
an array of cipher suites enabled, or null
See Also:
SSLSocket.setEnabledCipherSuites(java.lang.String[])


"
SslRMIServerSocketFactory,getEnabledProtocols(),String[],"Returns the names of the protocol versions enabled on SSL connections accepted by server sockets created by this factory, or null if this factory uses the protocol versions that are enabled by default.","

getEnabledProtocols
public final String[] getEnabledProtocols()
Returns the names of the protocol versions enabled on SSL
 connections accepted by server sockets created by this factory,
 or null if this factory uses the protocol versions
 that are enabled by default.

Returns:
an array of protocol versions enabled, or
 null
See Also:
SSLSocket.setEnabledProtocols(java.lang.String[])


"
SslRMIServerSocketFactory,getNeedClientAuth(),boolean,Returns true if client authentication is required on SSL connections accepted by server sockets created by this factory.,"

getNeedClientAuth
public final boolean getNeedClientAuth()
Returns true if client authentication is
 required on SSL connections accepted by server sockets created
 by this factory.

Returns:
true if client authentication is required
See Also:
SSLSocket.setNeedClientAuth(boolean)
