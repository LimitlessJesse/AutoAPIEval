ClassName,URL,Description
BeanDescriptor,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/BeanDescriptor.html,"A BeanDescriptor provides global information about a ""bean"", including its Java class, its displayName, etc."
Beans,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/Beans.html,This class provides some general purpose beans control methods.
DefaultPersistenceDelegate,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/DefaultPersistenceDelegate.html,The DefaultPersistenceDelegate is a concrete implementation of the abstract PersistenceDelegate class and is the delegate used by default for classes about which no information is available.
Encoder,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/Encoder.html,An Encoder is a class which can be used to create files or streams that encode the state of a collection of JavaBeans in terms of their public APIs.
EventHandler,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/EventHandler.html,The EventHandler class provides support for dynamically generating event listeners whose methods execute a simple statement involving an incoming event object and a target object.
EventSetDescriptor,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/EventSetDescriptor.html,An EventSetDescriptor describes a group of events that a given Java bean fires.
Expression,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/Expression.html,"An Expression object represents a primitive expression in which a single method is applied to a target and a set of arguments to return a result - as in ""a.getFoo()""."
FeatureDescriptor,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/FeatureDescriptor.html,"The FeatureDescriptor class is the common baseclass for PropertyDescriptor, EventSetDescriptor, and MethodDescriptor, etc."
IndexedPropertyChangeEvent,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/IndexedPropertyChangeEvent.html,"An ""IndexedPropertyChange"" event gets delivered whenever a component that conforms to the JavaBeansâ„¢ specification (a ""bean"") changes a bound indexed property."
IndexedPropertyDescriptor,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/IndexedPropertyDescriptor.html,An IndexedPropertyDescriptor describes a property that acts like an array and has an indexed read and/or indexed write method to access specific elements of the array.
Introspector,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/Introspector.html,"The Introspector class provides a standard way for tools to learn about the properties, events, and methods supported by a target Java Bean."
MethodDescriptor,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/MethodDescriptor.html,A MethodDescriptor describes a particular method that a Java Bean supports for external access from other components.
ParameterDescriptor,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/ParameterDescriptor.html,"The ParameterDescriptor class allows bean implementors to provide additional information on each of their parameters, beyond the low level type information provided by the java.lang.reflect.Method class."
PersistenceDelegate,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/PersistenceDelegate.html,The PersistenceDelegate class takes the responsibility for expressing the state of an instance of a given class in terms of the methods in the class's public API.
PropertyChangeEvent,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyChangeEvent.html,"A ""PropertyChange"" event gets delivered whenever a bean changes a ""bound"" or ""constrained"" property."
PropertyChangeListenerProxy,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyChangeListenerProxy.html,"A class which extends the EventListenerProxy specifically for adding a PropertyChangeListener with a ""bound"" property."
PropertyChangeSupport,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyChangeSupport.html,This is a utility class that can be used by beans that support bound properties.
PropertyDescriptor,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyDescriptor.html,A PropertyDescriptor describes one property that a Java Bean exports via a pair of accessor methods.
PropertyEditorManager,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyEditorManager.html,The PropertyEditorManager can be used to locate a property editor for any given type name.
PropertyEditorSupport,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyEditorSupport.html,This is a support class to help build property editors.
SimpleBeanInfo,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/SimpleBeanInfo.html,This is a support class to make it easier for people to provide BeanInfo classes.
Statement,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/Statement.html,"A Statement object represents a primitive statement in which a single method is applied to a target and a set of arguments - as in ""a.setFoo(b)""."
VetoableChangeListenerProxy,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/VetoableChangeListenerProxy.html,"A class which extends the EventListenerProxy specifically for adding a VetoableChangeListener with a ""constrained"" property."
VetoableChangeSupport,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/VetoableChangeSupport.html,This is a utility class that can be used by beans that support constrained properties.
XMLDecoder,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/XMLDecoder.html,The XMLDecoder class is used to read XML documents created using the XMLEncoder and is used just like the ObjectInputStream.
XMLEncoder,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/XMLEncoder.html,The XMLEncoder class is a complementary alternative to the ObjectOutputStream and can used to generate a textual representation of a JavaBean in the same way that the ObjectOutputStream can be used to create binary representation of Serializable objects.
