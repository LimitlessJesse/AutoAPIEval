select
public abstract KeySelectorResult select(KeyInfo keyInfo,
                                         KeySelector.Purpose purpose,
                                         AlgorithmMethod method,
                                         XMLCryptoContext context)
                                  throws KeySelectorException
Attempts to find a key that satisfies the specified constraints.

Parameters:
keyInfo - a KeyInfo (may be null)
purpose - the key's purpose (KeySelector.Purpose.SIGN,
    KeySelector.Purpose.VERIFY, KeySelector.Purpose.ENCRYPT, or
    KeySelector.Purpose.DECRYPT)
method - the algorithm method that this key is to be used for.
    Only keys that are compatible with the algorithm and meet the
    constraints of the specified algorithm should be returned.
context - an XMLCryptoContext that may contain
    useful information for finding an appropriate key. If this key
    selector supports resolving RetrievalMethod types, the
    context's baseURI and dereferencer
    parameters (if specified) should be used by the selector to
    resolve and dereference the URI.
Returns:
the result of the key selector
Throws:
KeySelectorException - if an exceptional condition occurs while
    attempting to find a key. Note that an inability to find a key is not
    considered an exception (null should be
    returned in that case). However, an error condition (ex: network
    communications failure) that prevented the KeySelector
    from finding a potential key should be considered an exception.
ClassCastException - if the data type of method
    is not supported by this key selector


"
KeySelector,singletonKeySelector(Key key),static KeySelector,"Returns a KeySelector that always selects the specified key, regardless of the KeyInfo passed to it.","

singletonKeySelector
public static KeySelector singletonKeySelector(Key key)
Returns a KeySelector that always selects the specified
 key, regardless of the KeyInfo passed to it.

Parameters:
key - the sole key to be stored in the key selector
Returns:
a key selector that always selects the specified key
Throws:
NullPointerException - if key is null
