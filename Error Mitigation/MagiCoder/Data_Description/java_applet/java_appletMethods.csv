ClassName,Method,Return Type,Description,Full Description
Applet,destroy(),void,Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it is being reclaimed and that it should destroy any resources that it has allocated.,"

destroy
public void destroy()
Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform
 this applet that it is being reclaimed and that it should destroy
 any resources that it has allocated. The stop method
 will always be called before destroy.
 
 A subclass of Applet should override this method if
 it has any operation that it wants to perform before it is
 destroyed. For example, an applet with threads would use the
 init method to create the threads and the
 destroy method to kill them.
 
 The implementation of this method provided by the
 Applet class does nothing.

start(),

"
Applet,init(),void,Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it has been loaded into the system.,"

init
public void init()
Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform
 this applet that it has been loaded into the system. It is always
 called before the first time that the start method is
 called.
 
 A subclass of Applet should override this method if
 it has initialization to perform. For example, an applet with
 threads would use the init method to create the
 threads and the destroy method to kill them.
 
 The implementation of this method provided by the
 Applet class does nothing.

See Also:
destroy(), 
start(), 
stop()


"

Determines if this applet is active. An applet is marked active
 just before its start method is called. It becomes
 inactive just before its stop method is called.

Returns:
true if the applet is active;
          false otherwise.
See Also:
start(), 
stop()


"
Applet,isValidateRoot(),boolean,Indicates if this container is a validate root.,"

isValidateRoot
public boolean isValidateRoot()
Indicates if this container is a validate root.
 
Applet objects are the validate roots, and, therefore, they
 override this method to return true.

Overrides:
isValidateRoot in class Container
Returns:
true
Since:
1.7
See Also:
Container.isValidateRoot()


"
Applet,newAudioClip(URL url),static AudioClip,Get an audio clip from the given URL.,"

play
public void play(URL url,
                 String name)

 relative to it. Nothing happens if the audio clip cannot be found.

Parameters:
url - an absolute URL giving the base location of the
                 audio clip.
name - the location of the audio clip, relative to the
                 url argument.


"
Applet,resize(Dimension d),void,Requests that this applet be resized.,"

resize
public void resize(Dimension d)
Requests that this applet be resized.

Overrides:
resize in class Component
Parameters:
d - an object giving the new width and height.


"
Applet,"resize(int width, int height)",void,Requests that this applet be resized.,"

resize
public void resize(int width,
                   int height)
Requests that this applet be resized.

Overrides:
resize in class Component
Parameters:
width - the new requested width for the applet.
height - the new requested height for the applet.


"
Applet,setStub(AppletStub stub),void,Sets this applet's stub.,"

setStub
public final void setStub(AppletStub stub)
Sets this applet's stub. This is done automatically by the system.
 If there is a security manager, its  checkPermission 
 method is called with the
 AWTPermission(""setAppletStub"")
 permission if a stub has already been set.

Parameters:
stub - the new stub.
Throws:
SecurityException - if the caller cannot set the stub


"
Applet,showStatus(String msg),void,"Requests that the argument string be displayed in the ""status window"".","

showStatus
public void showStatus(String msg)
Requests that the argument string be displayed in the
 ""status window"". Many browsers and applet viewers
 provide such a window, where the application can inform users of
 its current state.

Parameters:
msg - a string to display in the status window.


"
Applet,start(),void,Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it should start its execution.,"

start
public void start()
Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform
 this applet that it should start its execution. It is called after
 the init method and each time the applet is revisited
 in a Web page.
 
 A subclass of Applet should override this method if
 it has any operation that it wants to perform each time the Web
 page containing it is visited. For example, an applet with
 animation might want to use the start method to
 resume animation, and the stop method to suspend the
 animation.
 
 Note: some methods, such as getLocationOnScreen, can only
 provide meaningful results if the applet is showing.  Because
 isShowing returns false when the applet's
 start is first called, methods requiring
 isShowing to return true should be called from
 a ComponentListener.
 
 The implementation of this method provided by the
 Applet class does nothing.

See Also:
destroy(), 
init(), 
stop(), 
Component.isShowing(), 
ComponentListener.componentShown(java.awt.event.ComponentEvent)


"
Applet,stop(),void,Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it should stop its execution.,"

stop
public void stop()
Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform
 this applet that it should stop its execution. It is called when
 the Web page that contains this applet has been replaced by
 another page, and also just before the applet is to be destroyed.
 
 A subclass of Applet should override this method if
 it has any operation that it wants to perform each time the Web
 page containing it is no longer visible. For example, an applet
 with animation might want to use the start method to
 resume animation, and the stop method to suspend the
 animation.
 
 The implementation of this method provided by the
 Applet class does nothing.
