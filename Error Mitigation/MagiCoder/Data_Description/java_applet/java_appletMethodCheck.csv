0,Applet,1,void init(),True,Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it has been loaded into the system.,"

init
public void init()
Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform
 this applet that it has been loaded into the system. It is always
 called before the first time that the start method is
 called.
 
 A subclass of Applet should override this method if
 it has initialization to perform. For example, an applet with
 threads would use the init method to create the
 threads and the destroy method to kill them.
 
 The implementation of this method provided by the
 Applet class does nothing.

start(), 
stop()


"
0,Applet,2,void start(),True,Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it should start its execution.,"

start
public void start()
Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform
 this applet that it should start its execution. It is called after
 the init method and each time the applet is revisited
 in a Web page.
 
 A subclass of Applet should override this method if
 it has any operation that it wants to perform each time the Web
 page containing it is visited. For example, an applet with
 animation might want to use the start method to
 resume animation, and the stop method to suspend the
 animation.
 
 Note: some methods, such as getLocationOnScreen, can only
 provide meaningful results if the applet is showing.  Because
 isShowing returns false when the applet's
 start is first called, methods requiring
 isShowing to return true should be called from
 a ComponentListener.
 
 The implementation of this method provided by the
 Applet class does nothing.

"
0,Applet,3,void stop(),True,Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it should stop its execution.,"

stop
public void stop()
Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform
 this applet that it should stop its execution. It is called when
 the Web page that contains this applet has been replaced by
 another page, and also just before the applet is to be destroyed.
 
 A subclass of Applet should override this method if
 it has any operation that it wants to perform each time the Web
 page containing it is no longer visible. For example, an applet
 with animation might want to use the start method to
 resume animation, and the stop method to suspend the
 animation.
 
 The implementation of this method provided by the
 Applet class does nothing.

"
0,Applet,4,void destroy(),True,Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform this applet that it is being reclaimed and that it should destroy any resources that it has allocated.,"

destroy
public void destroy()
Called by the browser or applet viewer to inform
 this applet that it is being reclaimed and that it should destroy
 any resources that it has allocated. The stop method
 will always be called before destroy.
 
 A subclass of Applet should override this method if
 it has any operation that it wants to perform before it is
 destroyed. For example, an applet with threads would use the
 init method to create the threads and the
 destroy method to kill them.
 
 The implementation of this method provided by the
 Applet class does nothing.
