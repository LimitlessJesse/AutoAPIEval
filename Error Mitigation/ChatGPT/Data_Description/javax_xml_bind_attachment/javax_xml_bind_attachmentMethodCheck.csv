addMtomAttachment
public abstract String addMtomAttachment(DataHandler data,
                                         String elementNamespace,
                                         String elementLocalName)
Consider MIME content data for optimized binary storage as an attachment.

 
 This method is called by JAXB marshal process when isXOPPackage() is
 true, for each element whose datatype is ""base64Binary"", as described in
 Step 3 in
 Creating XOP Packages.

 
 The method implementor determines whether data shall be attached separately
 or inlined as base64Binary data. If the implementation chooses to optimize the storage
 of the binary data as a MIME part, it is responsible for attaching data to the
 MIME-based package, and then assigning an unique content-id, cid, that identifies
 the MIME part within the MIME message. This method returns the cid,
 which enables the JAXB marshaller to marshal a XOP element that refers to that cid in place
 of marshalling the binary data. When the method returns null, the JAXB marshaller
 inlines data as base64binary data.

 
 The caller of this method is required to meet the following constraint.
 If the element infoset item containing data has the attribute
 xmime:contentType or if the JAXB property/field representing
 datais annotated with a known MIME type,
 data.getContentType() should be set to that MIME type.

 
 The elementNamespace and elementLocalName
 parameters provide the
 context that contains the binary data. This information could
 be used by the MIME-based package processor to determine if the
 binary data should be inlined or optimized as an attachment.

Parameters:
data - represents the data to be attached. Must be non-null.
elementNamespace - the namespace URI of the element that encloses the base64Binary data.
      Can be empty but never null.
elementLocalName - The local name of the element. Always a non-null valid string.
Returns:
a valid content-id URI (see RFC 2387) that identifies the attachment containing data.
     Otherwise, null if the attachment was not added and should instead be inlined in the message.

0,AttachmentMarshaller,4,String addSwaRefAttachment(DataHandler data),True,,"

addSwaRefAttachment
public abstract String addSwaRefAttachment(DataHandler data)
Add MIME data as an attachment and return attachment's content-id, cid.

 This method is called by JAXB marshal process for each element/attribute typed as
 {http://ws-i.org/profiles/basic/1.1/xsd}swaRef. The MIME-based package processor
 implementing this method is responsible for attaching the specified data to a
 MIME attachment, and generating a content-id, cid, that uniquely identifies the attachment
 within the MIME-based package.

 Caller inserts the returned content-id, cid, into the XML content being marshalled.

Parameters:
data - represents the data to be attached. Must be non-null.
Returns:
must be a valid URI used as cid. Must satisfy Conformance Requirement R2928 from
       WS-I Attachments Profile Version 1.0.

getAttachmentAsDataHandler
public abstract DataHandler getAttachmentAsDataHandler(String cid)
Lookup MIME content by content-id, cid, and return as a DataHandler.
The returned DataHandler instance must be configured
 to meet the following required mapping constaint.
 



       Required Mappings between MIME and Java Types

 Note that it is allowable to support additional mappings.

Parameters:
cid - It is expected to be a valid lexical form of the XML Schema
 xs:anyURI datatype. If isXOPPackage()
 ==true, it must be a valid URI per the cid: URI scheme (see RFC 2387)
Returns:
a DataHandler that represents the MIME attachment.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the attachment for the given cid is not found.


"
1,AttachmentUnmarshaller,2,byte[] getAttachmentAsByteArray(String contentId),True,,"

getAttachmentAsByteArray
public abstract byte[] getAttachmentAsByteArray(String cid)
Retrieve the attachment identified by content-id, cid,  as a byte[].

Parameters:
cid - It is expected to be a valid lexical form of the XML Schema
 xs:anyURI datatype. If isXOPPackage()
 ==true, it must be a valid URI per the cid: URI scheme (see RFC 2387)
Returns:
byte[] representation of attachment identified by cid.
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the attachment for the given cid is not found.

isXOPPackage
public boolean isXOPPackage()
Read-only property that returns true if JAXB unmarshaller needs to perform XOP processing.
This method returns true when the constraints specified
 in  Identifying XOP Documents are met.
 This value must not change during the unmarshalling process.

Returns:
true when MIME context is a XOP Document.
