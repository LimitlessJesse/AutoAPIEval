ClassName,URL,Description
Cipher,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/Cipher.html,This class provides the functionality of a cryptographic cipher for encryption and decryption.
CipherInputStream,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/CipherInputStream.html,A CipherInputStream is composed of an InputStream and a Cipher so that read() methods return data that are read in from the underlying InputStream but have been additionally processed by the Cipher.
CipherOutputStream,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/CipherOutputStream.html,A CipherOutputStream is composed of an OutputStream and a Cipher so that write() methods first process the data before writing them out to the underlying OutputStream.
CipherSpi,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/CipherSpi.html,This class defines the Service Provider Interface (SPI) for the Cipher class.
EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo.html,This class implements the EncryptedPrivateKeyInfo type as defined in PKCS #8.
ExemptionMechanism,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/ExemptionMechanism.html,"This class provides the functionality of an exemption mechanism, examples of which are key recovery, key weakening, and key escrow."
ExemptionMechanismSpi,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/ExemptionMechanismSpi.html,This class defines the Service Provider Interface (SPI) for the ExemptionMechanism class.
KeyAgreement,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/KeyAgreement.html,This class provides the functionality of a key agreement (or key exchange) protocol.
KeyAgreementSpi,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/KeyAgreementSpi.html,This class defines the Service Provider Interface (SPI) for the KeyAgreement class.
KeyGenerator,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/KeyGenerator.html,This class provides the functionality of a secret (symmetric) key generator.
KeyGeneratorSpi,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/KeyGeneratorSpi.html,This class defines the Service Provider Interface (SPI) for the KeyGenerator class.
Mac,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/Mac.html,"This class provides the functionality of a ""Message Authentication Code"" (MAC) algorithm."
MacSpi,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/MacSpi.html,This class defines the Service Provider Interface (SPI) for the Mac class.
NullCipher,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/NullCipher.html,"The NullCipher class is a class that provides an ""identity cipher"" -- one that does not transform the plain text."
SealedObject,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/SealedObject.html,This class enables a programmer to create an object and protect its confidentiality with a cryptographic algorithm.
SecretKeyFactory,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/SecretKeyFactory.html,This class represents a factory for secret keys.
SecretKeyFactorySpi,https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/crypto/SecretKeyFactorySpi.html,This class defines the Service Provider Interface (SPI) for the SecretKeyFactory class.
