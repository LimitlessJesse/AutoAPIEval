equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Compares this MarshalledObject to another object.
 Returns true if and only if the argument refers to a
 MarshalledObject that contains exactly the same
 serialized representation of an object as this one does. The
 comparison ignores any class codebase annotation, meaning that
 two objects are equivalent if they have the same serialized
 representation except for the codebase of each class
 in the serialized representation.

Overrides:
equals in class Object
Parameters:
obj - the object to compare with this MarshalledObject
Returns:
true if the argument contains an equivalent
 serialized object; false otherwise

hashCode
public int hashCode()
Return a hash code for this MarshalledObject.

Overrides:
hashCode in class Object
Returns:
a hash code

bind
public static void bind(String name,

                        RemoteException
Binds the specified name to a remote object.

Parameters:
name - a name in URL format (without the scheme component)
obj - a reference for the remote object (usually a stub)
Throws:
AlreadyBoundException - if name is already bound
MalformedURLException - if the name is not an appropriately
  formatted URL
RemoteException - if registry could not be contacted
AccessException - if this operation is not permitted (if
 originating from a non-local host, for example)

                   throws RemoteException,
                          MalformedURLException
Rebinds the specified name to a new remote object. Any existing
 binding for the name is replaced.

Parameters:
name - a name in URL format (without the scheme component)
obj - new remote object to associate with the name
Throws:
MalformedURLException - if the name is not an appropriately
  formatted URL
RemoteException - if registry could not be contacted

                          MalformedURLException
Destroys the binding for the specified name that is associated
 with a remote object.

Parameters:
name - a name in URL format (without the scheme component)
Throws:
NotBoundException - if name is not currently bound

                     throws RemoteException,
                            MalformedURLException
Returns an array of the names bound in the registry.  The names are
 URL-formatted (without the scheme component) strings. The array contains
 a snapshot of the names present in the registry at the time of the
 call.

Parameters:
name - a registry name in URL format (without the scheme
          component)
Returns:
an array of names (in the appropriate format) bound
          in the registry
