createUnmarshaller
public DOMResult createUnmarshaller(ValidationEventHandler errorHandler)
Description copied from interface: DomHandler
When a JAXB provider needs to unmarshal a part of a document into an
 infoset representation, it first calls this method to create a
 Result object.

 
 A JAXB provider will then send a portion of the XML
 into the given result. Such a portion always form a subtree
 of the whole XML document rooted at an element.

Specified by:
createUnmarshaller in interface DomHandler<Element,DOMResult>
Parameters:
errorHandler - if any error happens between the invocation of this method
      and the invocation of DomHandler.getElement(Result), they
      must be reported to this handler.

      The caller must provide a non-null error handler.

      The Result object created from this method
      may hold a reference to this error handler.
Returns:
null if the operation fails. The error must have been reported
      to the error handler.

 If non-null, the returned Source must contain a whole document
 rooted at one element, which will then be weaved into a bigger document
 that the JAXB provider is marshalling.
