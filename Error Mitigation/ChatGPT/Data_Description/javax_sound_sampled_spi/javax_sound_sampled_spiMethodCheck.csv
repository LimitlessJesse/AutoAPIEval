0,AudioFileReader,5,AudioFileFormat getAudioFileFormat(InputStream stream),True,,"

getAudioFileFormat
public abstract AudioFileFormat getAudioFileFormat(InputStream stream)
                                            throws UnsupportedAudioFileException,
                                                   IOException
Obtains the audio file format of the input stream provided.  The stream must
 point to valid audio file data.  In general, audio file readers may
 need to read some data from the stream before determining whether they
 support it.  These parsers must
 be able to mark the stream, read enough data to determine whether they
 support the stream, and, if not, reset the stream's read pointer to its original
 position.  If the input stream does not support this, this method may fail
 with an IOException.

Parameters:
stream - the input stream from which file format information should be
 extracted
Returns:
an AudioFileFormat object describing the audio file format
Throws:
UnsupportedAudioFileException - if the stream does not point to valid audio
 file data recognized by the system
IOException - if an I/O exception occurs

                   throws IOException
Writes a stream of bytes representing an audio file of the file format
 indicated to the external file provided.

Parameters:
stream - the audio input stream containing audio data to be
 written to the file
fileType - file type to be written to the file
out - external file to which the file data should be written
Returns:
the number of bytes written to the file
Throws:
IOException - if an I/O exception occurs
IllegalArgumentException - if the file format is not supported by
 the system

write
public abstract int write(AudioInputStream stream,
                          AudioFileFormat.Type fileType,
                          OutputStream out)
                   throws IOException
Writes a stream of bytes representing an audio file of the file type
 indicated to the output stream provided.  Some file types require that
 the length be written into the file header, and cannot be written from
 start to finish unless the length is known in advance.  An attempt
 to write such a file type will fail with an IOException if the length in
 the audio file format is
 AudioSystem.NOT_SPECIFIED.

Parameters:
stream - the audio input stream containing audio data to be
 written to the output stream
fileType - file type to be written to the output stream
out - stream to which the file data should be written
Returns:
the number of bytes written to the output stream
Throws:
IOException - if an I/O exception occurs
IllegalArgumentException - if the file type is not supported by
 the system
