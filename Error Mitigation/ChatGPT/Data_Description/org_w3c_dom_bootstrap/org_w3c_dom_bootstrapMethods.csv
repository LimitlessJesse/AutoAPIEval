addSource
public void addSource(DOMImplementationSource s)
Register an implementation.

Parameters:
s - The source to be registered, may not be null


"

getDOMImplementation
public DOMImplementation getDOMImplementation(String features)
Return the first implementation that has the desired
 features, or null if none is found.

Parameters:
features - A string that specifies which features are required. This is
            a space separated list in which each feature is specified by
            its name optionally followed by a space and a version number.
            This is something like: ""XML 1.0 Traversal +Events 2.0""
Returns:
An implementation that has the desired features,
         or null if none found.

getDOMImplementationList
public DOMImplementationList getDOMImplementationList(String features)
Return a list of implementations that support the
 desired features.

Parameters:
features - A string that specifies which features are required. This is
            a space separated list in which each feature is specified by
            its name optionally followed by a space and a version number.
            This is something like: ""XML 1.0 Traversal +Events 2.0""
Returns:
A list of DOMImplementations that support the desired features.

newInstance
public static DOMImplementationRegistry newInstance()
                                             throws ClassNotFoundException,
                                                    InstantiationException,
                                                    IllegalAccessException,

Obtain a new instance of a DOMImplementationRegistry.


 The DOMImplementationRegistry is initialized by the
 application or the implementation, depending on the context, by
 first checking the value of the Java system property
 org.w3c.dom.DOMImplementationSourceList and
 the service provider whose contents are at
 ""META_INF/services/org.w3c.dom.DOMImplementationSourceList"".
 The value of this property is a white-space separated list of
 names of availables classes implementing the
 DOMImplementationSource interface. Each class listed
 in the class name list is instantiated and any exceptions
 encountered are thrown to the application.

Returns:
an initialized instance of DOMImplementationRegistry
Throws:
ClassNotFoundException - If any specified class can not be found
InstantiationException - If any specified class is an interface or abstract class
IllegalAccessException - If the default constructor of a specified class is not accessible
ClassCastException - If any specified class does not implement
 DOMImplementationSource
