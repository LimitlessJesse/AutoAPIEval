Returns an InterfaceDef object as a
 CORBA::Object that defines the runtime type of the
 CORBA::Object implemented by the Servant.
 The invoker of _get_interface_def
 must narrow the result to an InterfaceDef in order
 to use it.
 This default implementation of _get_interface_def()
 can be overridden
 by derived servants if the default behavior is not adequate.
 As defined in the CORBA 2.3.1 specification, section 11.3.1, the
 default behavior of _get_interface_def() is to use
 the most derived
 interface of a static servant or the most derived interface retrieved
 from a dynamic servant to obtain the InterfaceDef.
 This behavior must
 be supported by the Delegate that implements the
 Servant.

Returns:
get_interface_def an InterfaceDef
 object as a
 CORBA::Object that defines the runtime type of the
 CORBA::Object implemented by the Servant.

Description copied from interface: InvokeHandler
Invoked by the ORB to dispatch a request to the servant.

 ORB passes the method name, an InputStream containing the
 marshalled arguments, and a ResponseHandler which the servant
 uses to construct a proper reply.

 Only CORBA SystemException may be thrown by this method.

 The method must return an OutputStream created by the
 ResponseHandler which contains the marshalled reply.

 A servant must not retain a reference to the ResponseHandler
 beyond the lifetime of a method invocation.

 Servant behaviour is defined as follows:
 1. Determine correct method, and unmarshal parameters from
    InputStream.
 2. Invoke method implementation.
 3. If no user exception, create a normal reply using
    ResponseHandler.
 4. If user exception occurred, create exception reply using
    ResponseHandler.
 5. Marshal reply into OutputStream returned by
    ResponseHandler.
 6. Return OutputStream to ORB.
