"
1,Byte,3,Byte valueOf(byte b),True,,"

valueOf
public static Byte valueOf(byte b)
Returns a Byte instance representing the specified
 byte value.
 If a new Byte instance is not required, this method
 should generally be used in preference to the constructor
 Byte(byte), as this method is likely to yield
 significantly better space and time performance since
 all byte values are cached.

Parameters:
b - a byte value.
Returns:
a Byte instance representing b.
Since:
1.5


"
1,Byte,4,String toString(),True,,"

toString
public String toString()
Returns a String object representing this
 Byte's value.  The value is converted to signed
 decimal representation and returned as a string, exactly as if
 the byte value were given as an argument to the
 toString(byte) method.

 given by the specified String. The argument is
 interpreted as representing a signed decimal byte,
 exactly as if the argument were given to the parseByte(java.lang.String) method. The result is a
 Byte object that represents the byte
 value specified by the string.

  In other words, this method returns a Byte object
 equal to the value of:

 
new Byte(Byte.parseByte(s))


Parameters:
s - the string to be parsed
Returns:
a Byte object holding the value
                  represented by the string argument
Throws:
NumberFormatException - If the String does
                  not contain a parsable byte.

compareTo
public int compareTo(Character anotherCharacter)
Compares two Character objects numerically.

Specified by:
compareTo in interface Comparable<Character>
Parameters:
anotherCharacter - the Character to be compared.
Returns:
the value 0 if the argument Character
          is equal to this Character; a value less than
          0 if this Character is numerically less
          than the Character argument; and a value greater than
          0 if this Character is numerically greater
          than the Character argument (unsigned comparison).
          Note that this is strictly a numerical comparison; it is not
          locale-dependent.
Since:

5,Class,1,String getName(),True,,"

getName
public String getName()
Returns the  name of the entity (class, interface, array class,
 primitive type, or void) represented by this Class object,
 as a String.

  If this class object represents a reference type that is not an
 array type then the binary name of the class is returned, as specified
 by
 The Java™ Language Specification.

  If this class object represents a primitive type or void, then the
 name returned is a String equal to the Java language
 keyword corresponding to the primitive type or void.

  If this class object represents a class of arrays, then the internal
 form of the name consists of the name of the element type preceded by
 one or more '[' characters representing the depth of the array
 nesting.  The encoding of element type names is as follows:

 
 Element Type       Encoding
  boolean            Z
  byte               B
  char               C

  int                I
  long               J
  short              S
 
 The class or interface name classname is the binary name of
 the class specified above.

  Examples:
 
 String.class.getName()
     returns ""java.lang.String""
 byte.class.getName()
     returns ""byte""
 (new Object[3]).getClass().getName()
     returns ""[Ljava.lang.Object;""
 (new int[3][4][5][6][7][8][9]).getClass().getName()
     returns ""[[[[[[[I""
 

Returns:
the name of the class or interface
          represented by this object.


"
5,Class,2,Class<?>[] getInterfaces(),True,,"

getInterfaces
public Class<?>[] getInterfaces()
Determines the interfaces implemented by the class or interface
 represented by this object.

  If this object represents a class, the return value is an array
 containing objects representing all interfaces implemented by the
 class. The order of the interface objects in the array corresponds to
 the order of the interface names in the implements clause
 of the declaration of the class represented by this object. For
 example, given the declaration:
 
class Shimmer implements FloorWax, DessertTopping { ... }

 suppose the value of s is an instance of
 Shimmer; the value of the expression:
 
s.getClass().getInterfaces()[0]

 is the Class object that represents interface
 FloorWax; and the value of:
 
s.getClass().getInterfaces()[1]

 is the Class object that represents interface
 DessertTopping.

  If this object represents an interface, the array contains objects
 representing all interfaces extended by the interface. The order of the
 interface objects in the array corresponds to the order of the interface
 names in the extends clause of the declaration of the
 interface represented by this object.

  If this object represents a class or interface that implements no
 interfaces, the method returns an array of length 0.

  If this object represents a primitive type or void, the method
 returns an array of length 0.

  If this Class object represents an array type, the
 interfaces Cloneable and java.io.Serializable are
 returned in that order.

Returns:
an array of interfaces implemented by this class.


"

6,ClassLoader,1,Class<?> loadClass(String name),True,,"

loadClass
public Class<?> loadClass(String name)
                   throws ClassNotFoundException
Loads the class with the specified binary name.
 This method searches for classes in the same manner as the loadClass(String, boolean) method.  It is invoked by the Java virtual
 machine to resolve class references.  Invoking this method is equivalent
 to invoking loadClass(name,
 false).

Parameters:
name - The binary name of the class
Returns:
The resulting Class object
Throws:
ClassNotFoundException - If the class was not found


"
6,ClassLoader,2,Class<?> findClass(String name),True,,"

findClass
protected Class<?> findClass(String name)
                      throws ClassNotFoundException
Finds the class with the specified binary name.
 This method should be overridden by class loader implementations that
 follow the delegation model for loading classes, and will be invoked by
 the loadClass method after checking the
 parent class loader for the requested class.  The default implementation
 throws a ClassNotFoundException.

Parameters:
name - The binary name of the class
Returns:
The resulting Class object
Throws:
ClassNotFoundException - If the class could not be found
Since:

"
6,ClassLoader,3,URL getResource(String name),True,,"

getResource
public URL getResource(String name)
Finds the resource with the given name.  A resource is some data
 (images, audio, text, etc) that can be accessed by class code in a way
 that is independent of the location of the code.

  The name of a resource is a '/'-separated path name that
 identifies the resource.

  This method will first search the parent class loader for the
 resource; if the parent is null the path of the class loader
 built-in to the virtual machine is searched.  That failing, this method
 will invoke findResource(String) to find the resource.  

API Note:
When overriding this method it is recommended that an
 implementation ensures that any delegation is consistent with the getResources(String) method.
Parameters:
name - The resource name
Returns:
A URL object for reading the resource, or
          null if the resource could not be found or the invoker
          doesn't have adequate  privileges to get the resource.
Since:

getResources
public Enumeration<URL> getResources(String name)
                              throws IOException
Finds all the resources with the given name. A resource is some data
 (images, audio, text, etc) that can be accessed by class code in a way
 that is independent of the location of the code.

 The name of a resource is a /-separated path name that
 identifies the resource.

  The search order is described in the documentation for getResource(String).  

API Note:
When overriding this method it is recommended that an
 implementation ensures that any delegation is consistent with the getResource(String) method. This should
 ensure that the first element returned by the Enumeration's
 nextElement method is the same resource that the
 getResource(String) method would return.
Parameters:
name - The resource name
Returns:
An enumeration of URL objects for
          the resource.  If no resources could  be found, the enumeration
          will be empty.  Resources that the class loader doesn't have
          access to will not be in the enumeration.

                              throws ClassFormatError
Converts an array of bytes into an instance of class Class.
 Before the Class can be used it must be resolved.

  This method assigns a default ProtectionDomain to the newly defined class.  The
 ProtectionDomain is effectively granted the same set of
 permissions returned when Policy.getPolicy().getPermissions(new CodeSource(null, null))
 is invoked.  The default domain is created on the first invocation of
 defineClass,
 and re-used on subsequent invocations.

  To assign a specific ProtectionDomain to the class, use
 the defineClass method that takes a
 ProtectionDomain as one of its arguments.  

Parameters:
name - The expected binary name of the class, or
         null if not known
b - The bytes that make up the class data.  The bytes in positions
         off through off+len-1 should have the format
         of a valid class file as defined by
         The Java™ Virtual Machine Specification.
off - The start offset in b of the class data
len - The length of the class data
Returns:
The Class object that was created from the specified
          class data.
Throws:
ClassFormatError - If the data did not contain a valid class
IndexOutOfBoundsException - If either off or len is negative, or if
          off+len is greater than b.length.
SecurityException - If an attempt is made to add this class to a package that
          contains classes that were signed by a different set of
          certificates than this class (which is unsigned), or if
          name begins with ""java."".

7,ClassValue,1,Object get(Class<?> type),False,,NULL
7,ClassValue,2,void remove(Class<?> type),True,,"

remove
public void remove(Class<?> type)
Removes the associated value for the given class.
 If this value is subsequently read for the same class,
 its value will be reinitialized by invoking its computeValue method.
 This may result in an additional invocation of the
 computeValue method for the given class.
 
 In order to explain the interaction between get and remove calls,
 we must model the state transitions of a class value to take into account
 the alternation between uninitialized and initialized states.
 To do this, number these states sequentially from zero, and note that
 uninitialized (or removed) states are numbered with even numbers,
 while initialized (or re-initialized) states have odd numbers.
 
 When a thread T removes a class value in state 2N,
 nothing happens, since the class value is already uninitialized.
 Otherwise, the state is advanced atomically to 2N+1.
 
 When a thread T queries a class value in state 2N,
 the thread first attempts to initialize the class value to state 2N+1
 by invoking computeValue and installing the resulting value.
 
 When T attempts to install the newly computed value,
 if the state is still at 2N, the class value will be initialized
 with the computed value, advancing it to state 2N+1.
 
 Otherwise, whether the new state is even or odd,
 T will discard the newly computed value
 and retry the get operation.
 
 Discarding and retrying is an important proviso,
 since otherwise T could potentially install
 a disastrously stale value.  For example:
 
T calls CV.get(C) and sees state 2N
T quickly computes a time-dependent value V0 and gets ready to install it
 T is hit by an unlucky paging or scheduling event, and goes to sleep for a long time
 ...meanwhile, T2 also calls CV.get(C) and sees state 2N
T2 quickly computes a similar time-dependent value V1 and installs it on CV.get(C)
T2 (or a third thread) then calls CV.remove(C), undoing T2's work
  the previous actions of T2 are repeated several times
  also, the relevant computed values change over time: V1, V2, ...
 ...meanwhile, T wakes up and attempts to install V0; this must fail

 We can assume in the above scenario that CV.computeValue uses locks to properly
 observe the time-dependent states as it computes V1, etc.
 This does not remove the threat of a stale value, since there is a window of time
 between the return of computeValue in T and the installation
 of the the new value.  No user synchronization is possible during this time.

Parameters:
type - the type whose class value must be removed

NullPointerException - if the argument is null

9,Double,1,int compareTo(Double anotherDouble),True,,"

compareTo
public int compareTo(Double anotherDouble)
Compares two Double objects numerically.  There
 are two ways in which comparisons performed by this method
 differ from those performed by the Java language numerical
 comparison operators (<, <=, ==, >=, >)
 when applied to primitive double values:
 
Double.NaN is considered by this method
          to be equal to itself and greater than all other
          double values (including
          Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY).
 
0.0d is considered by this method to be greater
          than -0.0d.
 
 This ensures that the natural ordering of
 Double objects imposed by this method is consistent
 with equals.

Specified by:
compareTo in interface Comparable<Double>
Parameters:
anotherDouble - the Double to be compared.
Returns:
the value 0 if anotherDouble is
          numerically equal to this Double; a value
          less than 0 if this Double
          is numerically less than anotherDouble;

"
10,Enum,1,String name(),True,,"

name
public final String name()
Returns the name of this enum constant, exactly as declared in its

 operators (<, <=, ==, >=, >) when
 applied to primitive float values:

 
Float.NaN is considered by this method to
          be equal to itself and greater than all other
          float values
          (including Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY).
 
0.0f is considered by this method to be greater
          than -0.0f.
 

 This ensures that the natural ordering of Float
 objects imposed by this method is consistent with equals.

Specified by:
compareTo in interface Comparable<Float>
Parameters:
anotherFloat - the Float to be compared.
Returns:
the value 0 if anotherFloat is
          numerically equal to this Float; a value
          less than 0 if this Float
          is numerically less than anotherFloat;
          and a value greater than 0 if this
          Float is numerically greater than
          anotherFloat.

valueOf
public static Integer valueOf(int i)
Returns an Integer instance representing the specified
 int value.  If a new Integer instance is not
 required, this method should generally be used in preference to
 the constructor Integer(int), as this method is likely
 to yield significantly better space and time performance by
 caching frequently requested values.

valueOf
public static Integer valueOf(String s)
                       throws NumberFormatException
Returns an Integer object holding the
 value of the specified String. The argument is
 interpreted as representing a signed decimal integer, exactly
 as if the argument were given to the parseInt(java.lang.String) method. The result is an
 Integer object that represents the integer value
 specified by the string.

 In other words, this method returns an Integer
 object equal to the value of:

Parameters:
s - the string to be parsed.
Returns:
an Integer object holding the value
             represented by the string argument.

Returns an Integer object holding the value
 extracted from the specified String when parsed
 with the radix given by the second argument. The first argument
 is interpreted as representing a signed integer in the radix
 specified by the second argument, exactly as if the arguments
 were given to the parseInt(java.lang.String, int)
 method. The result is an Integer object that
 represents the integer value specified by the string.

 In other words, this method returns an Integer
 object equal to the value of:

 
new Integer(Integer.parseInt(s, radix))


Parameters:
s - the string to be parsed.
radix - the radix to be used in interpreting s
Returns:
an Integer object holding the value
             represented by the string argument in the specified
             radix.
Throws:

13,Integer,5,Integer decode(String nm),True,,"

decode
public static Integer decode(String nm)
                      throws NumberFormatException
Decodes a String into an Integer.
 Accepts decimal, hexadecimal, and octal numbers given
 by the following grammar:

 

DecodableString:
Signopt DecimalNumeral
Signopt 0x HexDigits
Signopt 0X HexDigits
Signopt # HexDigits
Signopt 0 OctalDigits
Sign:
-
+


DecimalNumeral, HexDigits, and OctalDigits
 are as defined in section 3.10.1 of
 The Java™ Language Specification,
 except that underscores are not accepted between digits.

 The sequence of characters following an optional
 sign and/or radix specifier (""0x"", ""0X"",
 ""#"", or leading zero) is parsed as by the Integer.parseInt method with the indicated radix (10, 16, or
 8).  This sequence of characters must represent a positive
 value or a NumberFormatException will be thrown.  The
 result is negated if first character of the specified String is the minus sign.  No whitespace characters are
 permitted in the String.

Parameters:
nm - the String to decode.
Returns:
an Integer object holding the int
             value represented by nm
Throws:
NumberFormatException - if the String does not
            contain a parsable integer.

valueOf
public static Long valueOf(long l)
Returns a Long instance representing the specified

abs
public static double abs(double a)
Returns the absolute value of a double value.
 If the argument is not negative, the argument is returned.
 If the argument is negative, the negation of the argument is returned.
 Special cases:
 If the argument is positive zero or negative zero, the result
 is positive zero.
 If the argument is infinite, the result is positive infinity.
 If the argument is NaN, the result is NaN.
 In other words, the result is the same as the value of the expression:

Parameters:
a - the argument whose absolute value is to be determined
Returns:
the absolute value of the argument.


"
15,Math,2,"double pow(double a, double b)",True,,"

pow
public static double pow(double a,
                         double b)
Returns the value of the first argument raised to the power of the
 second argument. Special cases:

 If the second argument is positive or negative zero, then the
 result is 1.0.
 If the second argument is 1.0, then the result is the same as the
 first argument.
 If the second argument is NaN, then the result is NaN.
 If the first argument is NaN and the second argument is nonzero,
 then the result is NaN.

 If
 
the absolute value of the first argument is greater than 1
 and the second argument is positive infinity, or
 the absolute value of the first argument is less than 1 and
 the second argument is negative infinity,
 
 then the result is positive infinity.

 If
 
the absolute value of the first argument is greater than 1 and
 the second argument is negative infinity, or
 the absolute value of the
 first argument is less than 1 and the second argument is positive
 infinity,
 
 then the result is positive zero.

 If the absolute value of the first argument equals 1 and the
 second argument is infinite, then the result is NaN.

 If
 
the first argument is positive zero and the second argument
 is greater than zero, or
 the first argument is positive infinity and the second
 argument is less than zero,
 
 then the result is positive zero.

 If
 
the first argument is positive zero and the second argument
 is less than zero, or
 the first argument is positive infinity and the second
 argument is greater than zero,
 
 then the result is positive infinity.

 If
 
the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
 is greater than zero but not a finite odd integer, or
 the first argument is negative infinity and the second
 argument is less than zero but not a finite odd integer,
 
 then the result is positive zero.

 If
 
the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
 is a positive finite odd integer, or
 the first argument is negative infinity and the second
 argument is a negative finite odd integer,
 
 then the result is negative zero.

 If
 
the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
 is less than zero but not a finite odd integer, or
 the first argument is negative infinity and the second
 argument is greater than zero but not a finite odd integer,
 
 then the result is positive infinity.

 If
 
the first argument is negative zero and the second argument
 is a negative finite odd integer, or
 the first argument is negative infinity and the second
 argument is a positive finite odd integer,
 
 then the result is negative infinity.

 If the first argument is finite and less than zero
 
 if the second argument is a finite even integer, the
 result is equal to the result of raising the absolute value of
 the first argument to the power of the second argument

 if the second argument is a finite odd integer, the result
 is equal to the negative of the result of raising the absolute
 value of the first argument to the power of the second
 argument

 if the second argument is finite and not an integer, then
 the result is NaN.
 
If both arguments are integers, then the result is exactly equal
 to the mathematical result of raising the first argument to the power
 of the second argument if that result can in fact be represented
 exactly as a double value.
(In the foregoing descriptions, a floating-point value is
 considered to be an integer if and only if it is finite and a
 fixed point of the method ceil or,
 equivalently, a fixed point of the method floor. A value is a fixed point of a one-argument
 method if and only if the result of applying the method to the
 value is equal to the value.)

 The computed result must be within 1 ulp of the exact result.
 Results must be semi-monotonic.

Parameters:

 If the argument is NaN or less than zero, then the result
 is NaN.
 If the argument is positive infinity, then the result is positive
 infinity.
 If the argument is positive zero or negative zero, then the
 result is the same as the argument.
 Otherwise, the result is the double value closest to
 the true mathematical square root of the argument value.

JDK1.1


"
17,Object,1,boolean equals(Object obj),True,,"

equals
public boolean equals(Object obj)
Indicates whether some other object is ""equal to"" this one.
 
 The equals method implements an equivalence relation
 on non-null object references:
 
It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value
     x, x.equals(x) should return
     true.
 It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values
     x and y, x.equals(y)
     should return true if and only if
     y.equals(x) returns true.
 It is transitive: for any non-null reference values
     x, y, and z, if
     x.equals(y) returns true and
     y.equals(z) returns true, then
     x.equals(z) should return true.
 It is consistent: for any non-null reference values
     x and y, multiple invocations of
     x.equals(y) consistently return true
     or consistently return false, provided no
     information used in equals comparisons on the
     objects is modified.
 For any non-null reference value x,
     x.equals(null) should return false.
 

 The equals method for class Object implements
 the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects;
 that is, for any non-null reference values x and
 y, this method returns true if and only
 if x and y refer to the same object
 (x == y has the value true).
 
 Note that it is generally necessary to override the hashCode
 method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the
 general contract for the hashCode method, which states
 that equal objects must have equal hash codes.

Parameters:
obj - the reference object with which to compare.
Returns:
true if this object is the same as the obj
          argument; false otherwise.
See Also:
hashCode(), 
HashMap


"
17,Object,2,int hashCode(),True,,"

hashCode
public int hashCode()
Returns a hash code value for the object. This method is
 supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by
 HashMap.
 
 The general contract of hashCode is:
 
Whenever it is invoked on the same object more than once during
     an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method
     must consistently return the same integer, provided no information
     used in equals comparisons on the object is modified.
     This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an
     application to another execution of the same application.
 If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object)
     method, then calling the hashCode method on each of
     the two objects must produce the same integer result.
 It is not required that if two objects are unequal
     according to the equals(java.lang.Object)
     method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the
     two objects must produce distinct integer results.  However, the
     programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results
     for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.
 

 As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by
 class Object does return distinct integers for distinct
 objects. (This is typically implemented by converting the internal
 address of the object into an integer, but this implementation
 technique is not required by the
 Java™ programming language.)

Returns:
a hash code value for this object.
See Also:
equals(java.lang.Object), 
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)


"
17,Object,3,String toString(),True,,"

toString
public String toString()
Returns a string representation of the object. In general, the
 toString method returns a string that
 ""textually represents"" this object. The result should
 be a concise but informative representation that is easy for a
 person to read.
 It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.
 
 The toString method for class Object
 returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the
 object is an instance, the at-sign character `@', and
 the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the
 object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the
 value of:
 

 getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())
 

Returns:
a string representation of the object.


"
17,Object,4,Class<?> getClass(),True,,"

getClass
public final Class<?> getClass()
Returns the runtime class of this Object. The returned
 Class object is the object that is locked by static synchronized methods of the represented class.

 The actual result type is Class<? extends |X|>
 where |X| is the erasure of the static type of the
 expression on which getClass is called. For
 example, no cast is required in this code fragment:

Number n = 0;                             
Class<? extends Number> c = n.getClass(); 


Returns:
The Class object that represents the runtime
         class of this object.
See  The Java™ Language Specification:
15.8.2 Class Literals


"
17,Object,5,void notify(),True,,"

notify
public final void notify()
Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's
 monitor. If any threads are waiting on this object, one of them
 is chosen to be awakened. The choice is arbitrary and occurs at
 the discretion of the implementation. A thread waits on an object's
 monitor by calling one of the wait methods.
 
 The awakened thread will not be able to proceed until the current
 thread relinquishes the lock on this object. The awakened thread will
 compete in the usual manner with any other threads that might be
 actively competing to synchronize on this object; for example, the
 awakened thread enjoys no reliable privilege or disadvantage in being
 the next thread to lock this object.
 
 This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
 of this object's monitor. A thread becomes the owner of the
 object's monitor in one of three ways:
 
By executing a synchronized instance method of that object.
 By executing the body of a synchronized statement
     that synchronizes on the object.
 For objects of type Class, by executing a
     synchronized static method of that class.
 

 Only one thread at a time can own an object's monitor.

Throws:
IllegalMonitorStateException - if the current thread is not
               the owner of this object's monitor.

"
18,Package,5,String getSpecificationVersion(),True,,"

getSpecificationVersion
public String getSpecificationVersion()
Returns the version number of the specification
 that this package implements.
 This version string must be a sequence of nonnegative decimal
 integers separated by "".""'s and may have leading zeros.
 When version strings are compared the most significant
 numbers are compared.

Returns:
the specification version, null is returned if it is not known.


"
19,Process,1,void destroy(),True,,"

destroy
public abstract void destroy()
Kills the subprocess. Whether the subprocess represented by this
 Process object is forcibly terminated or not is
 implementation dependent.

"
19,Process,2,int exitValue(),True,,"

exitValue
public abstract int exitValue()
Returns the exit value for the subprocess.

Returns:
the exit value of the subprocess represented by this
         Process object.  By convention, the value
         0 indicates normal termination.
Throws:
IllegalThreadStateException - if the subprocess represented
         by this Process object has not yet terminated


"
19,Process,3,InputStream getErrorStream(),True,,"

getErrorStream
public abstract InputStream getErrorStream()
Returns the input stream connected to the error output of the
 subprocess.  The stream obtains data piped from the error output
 of the process represented by this Process object.

 If the standard error of the subprocess has been redirected using
 ProcessBuilder.redirectError or
 ProcessBuilder.redirectErrorStream
 then this method will return a
 null input stream.

 Implementation note: It is a good idea for the returned
 input stream to be buffered.

Returns:
the input stream connected to the error output of
         the subprocess


"
19,Process,4,OutputStream getOutputStream(),True,,"

getOutputStream
public abstract OutputStream getOutputStream()
Returns the output stream connected to the normal input of the
 subprocess.  Output to the stream is piped into the standard
 input of the process represented by this Process object.

 If the standard input of the subprocess has been redirected using
 ProcessBuilder.redirectInput
 then this method will return a
 null output stream.

 Implementation note: It is a good idea for the returned
 output stream to be buffered.

Returns:
the output stream connected to the normal input of the
         subprocess


"
19,Process,5,int waitFor(),True,,"

waitFor
public abstract int waitFor()
                     throws InterruptedException
Causes the current thread to wait, if necessary, until the
 process represented by this Process object has
 terminated.  This method returns immediately if the subprocess
 has already terminated.  If the subprocess has not yet
 terminated, the calling thread will be blocked until the
 subprocess exits.

Returns:
the exit value of the subprocess represented by this
         Process object.  By convention, the value
         0 indicates normal termination.
Throws:
InterruptedException - if the current thread is
         interrupted by another
         thread while it is waiting, then the wait is ended and
         an InterruptedException is thrown.


"
20,ProcessBuilder,1,ProcessBuilder inheritIO(),True,,"

inheritIO
public ProcessBuilder inheritIO()
Sets the source and destination for subprocess standard I/O
 to be the same as those of the current Java process.

 This is a convenience method.  An invocation of the form
   
 pb.inheritIO()
 
 behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation
   
 pb.redirectInput(Redirect.INHERIT)
   .redirectOutput(Redirect.INHERIT)
   .redirectError(Redirect.INHERIT)
 

 This gives behavior equivalent to most operating system
 command interpreters, or the standard C library function
 system().

Returns:
this process builder
Since:
1.7


"
20,ProcessBuilder,2,Process start(),True,,"

start
public Process start()
              throws IOException
Starts a new process using the attributes of this process builder.

 The new process will
 invoke the command and arguments given by command(),
 in a working directory as given by directory(),
 with a process environment as given by environment().

 This method checks that the command is a valid operating
 system command.  Which commands are valid is system-dependent,
 but at the very least the command must be a non-empty list of
 non-null strings.

 A minimal set of system dependent environment variables may
 be required to start a process on some operating systems.
 As a result, the subprocess may inherit additional environment variable
 settings beyond those in the process builder's environment().

 If there is a security manager, its
 checkExec
 method is called with the first component of this object's
 command array as its argument. This may result in
 a SecurityException being thrown.

 Starting an operating system process is highly system-dependent.
 Among the many things that can go wrong are:
 
The operating system program file was not found.
 Access to the program file was denied.
 The working directory does not exist.
 
In such cases an exception will be thrown.  The exact nature
 of the exception is system-dependent, but it will always be a
 subclass of IOException.

 Subsequent modifications to this process builder will not
 affect the returned Process.

Returns:
a new Process object for managing the subprocess
Throws:
NullPointerException - if an element of the command list is null
IndexOutOfBoundsException - if the command is an empty list (has size 0)
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and
         
its
         checkExec
         method doesn't allow creation of the subprocess, or

         the standard input to the subprocess was
         redirected from a file
         and the security manager's
         checkRead method
         denies read access to the file, or

         the standard output or standard error of the
         subprocess was
         redirected to a file
         and the security manager's
         checkWrite method
         denies write access to the file

         
IOException - if an I/O error occurs

 methods and must be invoked with respect to the current runtime object.

Returns:
the Runtime object associated with the current
          Java application.


"
22,Runtime,2,void exit(int status),True,,"

exit
public void exit(int status)
Terminates the currently running Java virtual machine by initiating its
 shutdown sequence.  This method never returns normally.  The argument
 serves as a status code; by convention, a nonzero status code indicates
 abnormal termination.

  All registered shutdown hooks, if any,
 are started in some unspecified order and allowed to run concurrently
 until they finish.  Once this is done the virtual machine
 halts.

  If this method is invoked after all shutdown hooks have already
 been run and the status is nonzero then this method halts the
 virtual machine with the given status code. Otherwise, this method
 blocks indefinitely.

  The System.exit method is the
 conventional and convenient means of invoking this method.

Parameters:
status - Termination status.  By convention, a nonzero status code
         indicates abnormal termination.
Throws:
SecurityException - If a security manager is present and its
         checkExit method does not permit
         exiting with the specified status

"
22,Runtime,3,Process exec(String command),True,,"

exec
public Process exec(String command)
             throws IOException
Executes the specified string command in a separate process.

 This is a convenience method.  An invocation of the form
 exec(command)
 behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation
 exec(command, null, null).

Parameters:
command - a specified system command.
Returns:
A new Process object for managing the subprocess
Throws:
SecurityException - If a security manager exists and its
          checkExec
          method doesn't allow creation of the subprocess
IOException - If an I/O error occurs
NullPointerException - If command is null
IllegalArgumentException - If command is empty

          available for future allocated objects, measured in bytes.


"
22,Runtime,5,void gc(),True,,"

gc
public void gc()
Runs the garbage collector.
 Calling this method suggests that the Java virtual machine expend
 effort toward recycling unused objects in order to make the memory
 they currently occupy available for quick reuse. When control
 returns from the method call, the virtual machine has made
 its best effort to recycle all discarded objects.
 
 The name gc stands for ""garbage
 collector"". The virtual machine performs this recycling
 process automatically as needed, in a separate thread, even if the
 gc method is not invoked explicitly.
 
 The method System.gc() is the conventional and convenient
 means of invoking this method.

 whose length is specified by the argument. For every nonnegative
 index k less than newLength, the character at
 index k in the new character sequence is the same as the
 character at index k in the old sequence if k is less
 than the length of the old character sequence; otherwise, it is the
 null character '\u0000'.

 In other words, if the newLength argument is less than
 the current length, the length is changed to the specified length.
 
 If the newLength argument is greater than or equal
 to the current length, sufficient null characters
 ('\u0000') are appended so that
 length becomes the newLength argument.

 order, increasing the length of this sequence by the length of the
 argument. If str is null, then the four
 characters ""null"" are appended.
 
 Let n be the length of this character sequence just prior to
 execution of the append method. Then the character at
 index k in the new character sequence is equal to the character
 at index k in the old character sequence, if k is less
 than n; otherwise, it is equal to the character at index
 k-n in the argument str.

Inserts the string into this character sequence.
 
 The characters of the String argument are inserted, in
 order, into this sequence at the indicated offset, moving up any
 characters originally above that position and increasing the length
 of this sequence by the length of the argument. If
 str is null, then the four characters
 ""null"" are inserted into this sequence.
 
 The character at index k in the new character sequence is
 equal to:
 
the character at index k in the old character sequence, if
 k is less than offset
the character at index k-offset in the
 argument str, if k is not less than
 offset but is less than offset+str.length()
the character at index k-str.length() in the
 old character sequence, if k is not less than
 offset+str.length()

 The offset argument must be greater than or equal to
 0, and less than or equal to the length
 of this sequence.

 Calling the gc method suggests that the Java Virtual
 Machine expend effort toward recycling unused objects in order to
 make the memory they currently occupy available for quick reuse.
 When control returns from the method call, the Java Virtual
 Machine has made a best effort to reclaim space from all discarded
 objects.
 
 The call System.gc() is effectively equivalent to the
 call:
 
 Runtime.getRuntime().gc()

Runtime.gc()


"
31,System,4,String getProperty(String key),True,,"

getProperty
public static String getProperty(String key)
Gets the system property indicated by the specified key.
 
 First, if there is a security manager, its
 checkPropertyAccess method is called with the key as
 its argument. This may result in a SecurityException.
 
 If there is no current set of system properties, a set of system
 properties is first created and initialized in the same manner as
 for the getProperties method.

Parameters:
key - the name of the system property.
Returns:
the string value of the system property,
             or null if there is no property with that key.
Throws:
SecurityException - if a security manager exists and its
             checkPropertyAccess method doesn't allow
              access to the specified system property.
NullPointerException - if key is
             null.
IllegalArgumentException - if key is empty.

31,System,5,"void arraycopy(Object src, int srcPos, Object dest, int destPos, int length)",True,,"

arraycopy
public static void arraycopy(Object src,
                             int srcPos,
                             Object dest,
                             int destPos,
                             int length)
Copies an array from the specified source array, beginning at the
 specified position, to the specified position of the destination array.
 A subsequence of array components are copied from the source
 array referenced by src to the destination array
 referenced by dest. The number of components copied is
 equal to the length argument. The components at
 positions srcPos through
 srcPos+length-1 in the source array are copied into
 positions destPos through
 destPos+length-1, respectively, of the destination
 array.
 
 If the src and dest arguments refer to the
 same array object, then the copying is performed as if the
 components at positions srcPos through
 srcPos+length-1 were first copied to a temporary
 array with length components and then the contents of
 the temporary array were copied into positions
 destPos through destPos+length-1 of the
 destination array.
 
 If dest is null, then a
 NullPointerException is thrown.
 
 If src is null, then a
 NullPointerException is thrown and the destination
 array is not modified.
 
 Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an
 ArrayStoreException is thrown and the destination is
 not modified:
 
The src argument refers to an object that is not an
     array.
 The dest argument refers to an object that is not an
     array.
 The src argument and dest argument refer
     to arrays whose component types are different primitive types.
 The src argument refers to an array with a primitive
    component type and the dest argument refers to an array
     with a reference component type.
 The src argument refers to an array with a reference
    component type and the dest argument refers to an array
     with a primitive component type.
 

 Otherwise, if any of the following is true, an
 IndexOutOfBoundsException is
 thrown and the destination is not modified:
 
The srcPos argument is negative.
 The destPos argument is negative.
 The length argument is negative.
 srcPos+length is greater than
     src.length, the length of the source array.
 destPos+length is greater than
     dest.length, the length of the destination array.
 

 Otherwise, if any actual component of the source array from
 position srcPos through
 srcPos+length-1 cannot be converted to the component
 type of the destination array by assignment conversion, an
 ArrayStoreException is thrown. In this case, let
 k be the smallest nonnegative integer less than
 length such that src[srcPos+k]
 cannot be converted to the component type of the destination
 array; when the exception is thrown, source array components from
 positions srcPos through
 srcPos+k-1
 will already have been copied to destination array positions
 destPos through
 destPos+k-1 and no other
 positions of the destination array will have been modified.
 (Because of the restrictions already itemized, this
 paragraph effectively applies only to the situation where both
 arrays have component types that are reference types.)

Parameters:
src - the source array.
srcPos - starting position in the source array.
dest - the destination array.
destPos - starting position in the destination data.
length - the number of array elements to be copied.
Throws:
IndexOutOfBoundsException - if copying would cause
               access of data outside array bounds.
ArrayStoreException - if an element in the src
               array could not be stored into the dest array
               because of a type mismatch.
NullPointerException - if either src or
               dest is null.


"
32,Thread,1,void start(),True,,"

start
public void start()
Causes this thread to begin execution; the Java Virtual Machine
 calls the run method of this thread.
 
 The result is that two threads are running concurrently: the
 current thread (which returns from the call to the
 start method) and the other thread (which executes its
 run method).
 
 It is never legal to start a thread more than once.
 In particular, a thread may not be restarted once it has completed
 execution.

Throws:
IllegalThreadStateException - if the thread was already
               started.

run
public void run()
If this thread was constructed using a separate

"
32,Thread,3,void sleep(long millis) throws InterruptedException,True,,"

sleep
public static void sleep(long millis)
                  throws InterruptedException
Causes the currently executing thread to sleep (temporarily cease
 execution) for the specified number of milliseconds, subject to
 the precision and accuracy of system timers and schedulers. The thread
 does not lose ownership of any monitors.

Parameters:
millis - the length of time to sleep in milliseconds
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the value of millis is negative
InterruptedException - if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
          interrupted status of the current thread is
          cleared when this exception is thrown.


"
32,Thread,4,void join() throws InterruptedException,True,,"

join
public final void join()
                throws InterruptedException
Waits for this thread to die.

  An invocation of this method behaves in exactly the same
 way as the invocation

 
join(0)


Throws:
InterruptedException - if any thread has interrupted the current thread. The
          interrupted status of the current thread is
          cleared when this exception is thrown.

"
33,ThreadGroup,1,ThreadGroup(String name),False,,NULL
33,ThreadGroup,2,int activeCount(),True,,"

activeCount
public int activeCount()
Returns an estimate of the number of active threads in this thread
 group and its subgroups. Recursively iterates over all subgroups in
 this thread group.

  The value returned is only an estimate because the number of
 threads may change dynamically while this method traverses internal
 data structures, and might be affected by the presence of certain
 system threads. This method is intended primarily for debugging
 and monitoring purposes.

Returns:
an estimate of the number of active threads in this thread
          group and in any other thread group that has this thread
          group as an ancestor
Since:
JDK1.0


"

interrupt
public final void interrupt()
Interrupts all threads in this thread group.
 
 First, the checkAccess method of this thread group is
 called with no arguments; this may result in a security exception.
 
 This method then calls the interrupt method on all the
 threads in this thread group and in all of its subgroups.

Throws:
SecurityException - if the current thread is not allowed
               to access this thread group or any of the threads in

remove
public void remove()
Removes the current thread's value for this thread-local
 variable.  If this thread-local variable is subsequently
 read by the current thread, its value will be
 reinitialized by invoking its initialValue() method,
 unless its value is set by the current thread
 in the interim.  This may result in multiple invocations of the
 initialValue method in the current thread.

Returns the detail message string of this throwable.

Returns:
the detail message string of this Throwable instance
          (which may be null).


"
35,Throwable,2,void printStackTrace(),True,,"

printStackTrace
public void printStackTrace()
Prints this throwable and its backtrace to the
 standard error stream. This method prints a stack trace for this
 Throwable object on the error output stream that is
 the value of the field System.err. The first line of
 output contains the result of the toString() method for
 this object.  Remaining lines represent data previously recorded by
 the method fillInStackTrace(). The format of this
 information depends on the implementation, but the following
 example may be regarded as typical:
 
 java.lang.NullPointerException
         at MyClass.mash(MyClass.java:9)
         at MyClass.crunch(MyClass.java:6)
         at MyClass.main(MyClass.java:3)
 
 This example was produced by running the program:
 
 class MyClass {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         crunch(null);
     }
     static void crunch(int[] a) {
         mash(a);
     }
     static void mash(int[] b) {
         System.out.println(b[0]);
     }
 }
 
 The backtrace for a throwable with an initialized, non-null cause
 should generally include the backtrace for the cause.  The format
 of this information depends on the implementation, but the following
 example may be regarded as typical:
 
 HighLevelException: MidLevelException: LowLevelException
         at Junk.a(Junk.java:13)
         at Junk.main(Junk.java:4)
 Caused by: MidLevelException: LowLevelException
         at Junk.c(Junk.java:23)
         at Junk.b(Junk.java:17)
         at Junk.a(Junk.java:11)
         ... 1 more
 Caused by: LowLevelException
         at Junk.e(Junk.java:30)
         at Junk.d(Junk.java:27)
         at Junk.c(Junk.java:21)
         ... 3 more
 
 Note the presence of lines containing the characters ""..."".
 These lines indicate that the remainder of the stack trace for this
 exception matches the indicated number of frames from the bottom of the
 stack trace of the exception that was caused by this exception (the
 ""enclosing"" exception).  This shorthand can greatly reduce the length
 of the output in the common case where a wrapped exception is thrown
 from same method as the ""causative exception"" is caught.  The above
 example was produced by running the program:
 
 public class Junk {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
         try {
             a();
         } catch(HighLevelException e) {
             e.printStackTrace();
         }
     }
     static void a() throws HighLevelException {
         try {
             b();
         } catch(MidLevelException e) {
             throw new HighLevelException(e);
         }
     }
     static void b() throws MidLevelException {
         c();
     }
     static void c() throws MidLevelException {
         try {
             d();
         } catch(LowLevelException e) {
             throw new MidLevelException(e);
         }
     }
     static void d() throws LowLevelException {
        e();
     }
     static void e() throws LowLevelException {
         throw new LowLevelException();
     }
 }

 class HighLevelException extends Exception {
     HighLevelException(Throwable cause) { super(cause); }
 }

 class MidLevelException extends Exception {
     MidLevelException(Throwable cause)  { super(cause); }
 }

 class LowLevelException extends Exception {
 }
 
 As of release 7, the platform supports the notion of
 suppressed exceptions (in conjunction with the try-with-resources statement). Any exceptions that were
 suppressed in order to deliver an exception are printed out
 beneath the stack trace.  The format of this information
 depends on the implementation, but the following example may be
 regarded as typical:

 
 Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.Exception: Something happened
  at Foo.bar(Foo.java:10)
  at Foo.main(Foo.java:5)
  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 0
          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
          at Foo.bar(Foo.java:9)
          ... 1 more
 
 Note that the ""... n more"" notation is used on suppressed exceptions
 just at it is used on causes. Unlike causes, suppressed exceptions are
 indented beyond their ""containing exceptions.""

 An exception can have both a cause and one or more suppressed
 exceptions:
 
 Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.Exception: Main block
  at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:7)
  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 2
          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
          at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
  Suppressed: Resource$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
          at Resource.close(Resource.java:26)
          at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:5)
 Caused by: java.lang.Exception: I did it
  at Foo3.main(Foo3.java:8)
 
 Likewise, a suppressed exception can have a cause:
 
 Exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.Exception: Main block
  at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:6)
  Suppressed: Resource2$CloseFailException: Resource ID = 1
          at Resource2.close(Resource2.java:20)
          at Foo4.main(Foo4.java:5)
  Caused by: java.lang.Exception: Rats, you caught me
          at Resource2$CloseFailException.<init>(Resource2.java:45)
          ... 2 more
 

"
35,Throwable,3,Throwable getCause(),True,,"

getCause
public Throwable getCause()
Returns the cause of this throwable or null if the
 cause is nonexistent or unknown.  (The cause is the throwable that
 caused this throwable to get thrown.)

 This implementation returns the cause that was supplied via one of
 the constructors requiring a Throwable, or that was set after
 creation with the initCause(Throwable) method.  While it is
 typically unnecessary to override this method, a subclass can override
 it to return a cause set by some other means.  This is appropriate for
 a ""legacy chained throwable"" that predates the addition of chained
 exceptions to Throwable.  Note that it is not
 necessary to override any of the PrintStackTrace methods,
 all of which invoke the getCause method to determine the
 cause of a throwable.

Returns:
the cause of this throwable or null if the
          cause is nonexistent or unknown.
Since:
1.4


"
35,Throwable,4,String toString(),True,,"

toString
public String toString()
Returns a short description of this throwable.
 The result is the concatenation of:
 
 the name of the class of this object
  "": "" (a colon and a space)
  the result of invoking this object's getLocalizedMessage()
      method
 
 If getLocalizedMessage returns null, then just
 the class name is returned.

Overrides:
toString in class Object
Returns:
a string representation of this throwable.


"
35,Throwable,5,void addSuppressed(Throwable exception),True,,"

addSuppressed
public final void addSuppressed(Throwable exception)
Appends the specified exception to the exceptions that were
 suppressed in order to deliver this exception. This method is
 thread-safe and typically called (automatically and implicitly)
 by the try-with-resources statement.

 The suppression behavior is enabled unless disabled
 via
 a constructor.  When suppression is disabled, this method does
 nothing other than to validate its argument.

 Note that when one exception causes another exception, the first
 exception is usually caught and then the second exception is
 thrown in response.  In other words, there is a causal
 connection between the two exceptions.

 In contrast, there are situations where two independent
 exceptions can be thrown in sibling code blocks, in particular
 in the try block of a try-with-resources
 statement and the compiler-generated finally block
 which closes the resource.

 In these situations, only one of the thrown exceptions can be
 propagated.  In the try-with-resources statement, when
 there are two such exceptions, the exception originating from
 the try block is propagated and the exception from the
 finally block is added to the list of exceptions
 suppressed by the exception from the try block.  As an
 exception unwinds the stack, it can accumulate multiple
 suppressed exceptions.

 An exception may have suppressed exceptions while also being
 caused by another exception.  Whether or not an exception has a
 cause is semantically known at the time of its creation, unlike
 whether or not an exception will suppress other exceptions
 which is typically only determined after an exception is
 thrown.

 Note that programmer written code is also able to take
 advantage of calling this method in situations where there are
 multiple sibling exceptions and only one can be propagated.

Parameters:
exception - the exception to be added to the list of
        suppressed exceptions
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if exception is this
         throwable; a throwable cannot suppress itself.
NullPointerException - if exception is null
