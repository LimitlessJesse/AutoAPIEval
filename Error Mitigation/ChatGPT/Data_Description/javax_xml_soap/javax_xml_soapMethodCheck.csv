createMessage
public abstract SOAPMessage createMessage()
                                   throws SOAPException
Creates a new SOAPMessage object with the default
 SOAPPart, SOAPEnvelope, SOAPBody,
 and SOAPHeader objects. Profile-specific message factories
 can choose to prepopulate the SOAPMessage object with
 profile-specific headers.
 
 Content can be added to this message's SOAPPart object, and
 the message can be sent ""as is"" when a message containing only a SOAP part
 is sufficient. Otherwise, the SOAPMessage object needs
 to create one or more AttachmentPart objects and
 add them to itself. Any content that is not in XML format must be
 in an AttachmentPart object.

Returns:
a new SOAPMessage object
Throws:
SOAPException - if a SOAP error occurs
UnsupportedOperationException - if the protocol of this
      MessageFactory instance is DYNAMIC_SOAP_PROTOCOL

        message in a transport-independent fashion for creation of the
        message
Returns:
a new SOAPMessage object containing the data from
         the given InputStream object
Throws:
IOException - if there is a problem in reading data from
            the input stream
SOAPException - may be thrown if the message is invalid
IllegalArgumentException - if the MessageFactory
      requires one or more MIME headers to be present in the
      headers parameter and they are missing.
      MessageFactory implementations for
      SOAP_1_1_PROTOCOL or
      SOAP_1_2_PROTOCOL must not throw
      IllegalArgumentException for this reason.

                                   throws SOAPException
Creates a SOAPElement object initialized with the
 given Name object. The concrete type of the return value
 will depend on the name given to the new SOAPElement. For
 instance, a new SOAPElement with the name
 ""{http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope}Envelope"" would cause a
 SOAPEnvelope that supports SOAP 1.2 behavior to be created.

saveChanges
public abstract void saveChanges()
                          throws SOAPException
Updates this SOAPMessage object with all the changes that
 have been made to it. This method is called automatically when
 writeTo(OutputStream) is  called. However, if
 changes are made to a message that was received or to one that has
 already been sent, the method saveChanges needs to be
 called explicitly in order to save the changes. The method saveChanges
 also generates any changes that can be read back (for example, a
 MessageId in profiles that support a message id). All MIME headers in a
 message that is created for sending purposes are guaranteed to have
 valid values only after saveChanges has been called.
 
 In addition, this method marks the point at which the data from all
 constituent AttachmentPart objects are pulled into the
 message.
 

Throws:
SOAPException - if there was a problem saving
               changes to this message.

Writes this SOAPMessage object to the given output
 stream. The externalization format is as defined by the SOAP 1.1 with
 Attachments specification.
 
 If there are no attachments, just an XML stream is written out. For
 those messages that have attachments, writeTo writes a
 MIME-encoded byte stream.
 
 Note that this method does not write the transport-specific MIME Headers
 of the Message

Parameters:
out - the OutputStream object to which this SOAPMessage
           object will be written
Throws:
IOException - if an I/O error occurs
SOAPException - if there was a problem in externalizing this SOAP message
