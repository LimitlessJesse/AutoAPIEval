1,PrintJobAdapter,1,void printDataTransferCompleted(PrintJobEvent pje),True,,"

printDataTransferCompleted
public void printDataTransferCompleted(PrintJobEvent pje)
Called to notify the client that data has been successfully
 transferred to the print service, and the client may free
 local resources allocated for that data.  The client should
 not assume that the data has been completely printed after
 receiving this event.

Specified by:
printDataTransferCompleted in interface PrintJobListener
Parameters:
pje - the event being notified


"
1,PrintJobAdapter,2,void printJobCompleted(PrintJobEvent pje),True,,"

printJobCompleted
public void printJobCompleted(PrintJobEvent pje)
Called to notify the client that the job completed successfully.

Specified by:
printJobCompleted in interface PrintJobListener
Parameters:
pje - the event being notified


"
1,PrintJobAdapter,3,void printJobFailed(PrintJobEvent pje),True,,"

printJobFailed
public void printJobFailed(PrintJobEvent pje)
Called to notify the client that the job failed to complete
 successfully and will have to be resubmitted.

Specified by:
printJobFailed in interface PrintJobListener

 has successfully completed, but the printing system
 is limited in capability and cannot verify this.
 This event is required to be delivered if none of the other
 terminal events (completed/failed/canceled) are delivered.

Specified by:
printJobNoMoreEvents in interface PrintJobListener
Parameters:
pje - the event being notified
