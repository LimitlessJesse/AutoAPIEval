0,SAXResult,1,void setHandler(ContentHandler handler),True,,"

setHandler
public void setHandler(ContentHandler handler)
Set the target to be a SAX2 ContentHandler.

Parameters:
handler - Must be a non-null ContentHandler reference.


"
0,SAXResult,2,void setLexicalHandler(LexicalHandler handler),True,,"

setLexicalHandler
public void setLexicalHandler(LexicalHandler handler)
Set the SAX2 LexicalHandler for the output.

 This is needed to handle XML comments and the like.  If the
 lexical handler is not set, an attempt should be made by the
 transformer to cast the ContentHandler to a
 LexicalHandler.

Parameters:
handler - A non-null LexicalHandler for
 handling lexical parse events.


"
0,SAXResult,3,void setSystemId(String systemId),True,,"

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(String systemId)
Method setSystemId Set the systemID that may be used in association
 with the ContentHandler.

Specified by:
setSystemId in interface Result
Parameters:
systemId - The system identifier as a URI string.


"
0,SAXResult,4,ContentHandler getHandler(),True,,"

getHandler
public ContentHandler getHandler()
Get the ContentHandler that is the Result.

Returns:
The ContentHandler that is to be transformation output.


"
0,SAXResult,5,LexicalHandler getLexicalHandler(),True,,"

getLexicalHandler
public LexicalHandler getLexicalHandler()
Get a SAX2 LexicalHandler for the output.

Returns:
A LexicalHandler, or null.

1,SAXSource,1,org.xml.sax.InputSource getInputSource(),False,,NULL
1,SAXSource,2,void setXMLReader(org.xml.sax.XMLReader reader),False,,NULL
1,SAXSource,3,void setSystemId(String systemId),True,,"

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(String systemId)
Set the system identifier for this Source.  If an input source
 has already been set, it will set the system ID or that
 input source, otherwise it will create a new input source.

 The system identifier is optional if there is a byte stream
 or a character stream, but it is still useful to provide one,
 since the application can use it to resolve relative URIs
 and can include it in error messages and warnings (the parser
 will attempt to open a connection to the URI only if
 no byte stream or character stream is specified).

Specified by:
setSystemId in interface Source
Parameters:
systemId - The system identifier as a URI string.

newTransformerHandler
public abstract TransformerHandler newTransformerHandler()
                                                  throws TransformerConfigurationException
Get a TransformerHandler object that can process SAX
 ContentHandler events into a Result. The transformation
 is defined as an identity (or copy) transformation, for example
 to copy a series of SAX parse events into a DOM tree.

Returns:
A non-null reference to a TransformerHandler, that may
 be used as a ContentHandler for SAX parse events.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException - If for some reason the
 TransformerHandler cannot be created.


"
2,SAXTransformerFactory,2,TransformerHandler newTransformerHandler(Source src),True,,"

newTransformerHandler
public abstract TransformerHandler newTransformerHandler(Source src)
                                                  throws TransformerConfigurationException
Get a TransformerHandler object that can process SAX
 ContentHandler events into a Result, based on the transformation
 instructions specified by the argument.

Parameters:
src - The Source of the transformation instructions.
Returns:
TransformerHandler ready to transform SAX events.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException - If for some reason the
 TransformerHandler can not be created.


"
2,SAXTransformerFactory,3,TemplatesHandler newTemplatesHandler(),True,,"

newTemplatesHandler
public abstract TemplatesHandler newTemplatesHandler()
                                              throws TransformerConfigurationException
Get a TemplatesHandler object that can process SAX
 ContentHandler events into a Templates object.

Returns:
A non-null reference to a TransformerHandler, that may
 be used as a ContentHandler for SAX parse events.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException - If for some reason the
 TemplatesHandler cannot be created.


"
2,SAXTransformerFactory,4,XMLFilter newXMLFilter(Source src),True,,"

newXMLFilter
public abstract XMLFilter newXMLFilter(Source src)
                                throws TransformerConfigurationException
Create an XMLFilter that uses the given Source as the
 transformation instructions.

Parameters:
src - The Source of the transformation instructions.
Returns:
An XMLFilter object, or null if this feature is not supported.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException - If for some reason the
 TemplatesHandler cannot be created.


"
2,SAXTransformerFactory,5,XMLFilter newXMLFilter(Templates templates),True,,"

newXMLFilter
public abstract XMLFilter newXMLFilter(Templates templates)
                                throws TransformerConfigurationException
Create an XMLFilter, based on the Templates argument..

Parameters:
templates - The compiled transformation instructions.
Returns:
An XMLFilter object, or null if this feature is not supported.
Throws:
TransformerConfigurationException - If for some reason the
 TemplatesHandler cannot be created.
