SAXResult,getHandler(),ContentHandler,Get the ContentHandler that is the Result.,"

getHandler
public ContentHandler getHandler()
Get the ContentHandler that is the Result.

Returns:
The ContentHandler that is to be transformation output.


"
SAXResult,getLexicalHandler(),LexicalHandler,Get a SAX2 LexicalHandler for the output.,"

getLexicalHandler
public LexicalHandler getLexicalHandler()
Get a SAX2 LexicalHandler for the output.

Returns:
A LexicalHandler, or null.


"
SAXResult,getSystemId(),String,Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.,"

getSystemId
public String getSystemId()
Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId.

Specified by:
getSystemId in interface Result
Returns:
The system identifier that was set with setSystemId, or null
 if setSystemId was not called.


"
SAXResult,setHandler(ContentHandler handler),void,Set the target to be a SAX2 ContentHandler.,"

setHandler
public void setHandler(ContentHandler handler)
Set the target to be a SAX2 ContentHandler.

Parameters:
handler - Must be a non-null ContentHandler reference.


"
SAXResult,setLexicalHandler(LexicalHandler handler),void,Set the SAX2 LexicalHandler for the output.,"

setLexicalHandler
public void setLexicalHandler(LexicalHandler handler)
Set the SAX2 LexicalHandler for the output.

 This is needed to handle XML comments and the like.  If the
 lexical handler is not set, an attempt should be made by the
 transformer to cast the ContentHandler to a
 LexicalHandler.

Parameters:
handler - A non-null LexicalHandler for
 handling lexical parse events.


"
SAXResult,setSystemId(String systemId),void,Method setSystemId Set the systemID that may be used in association with the ContentHandler.,"

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(String systemId)
Method setSystemId Set the systemID that may be used in association
 with the ContentHandler.

Specified by:
setSystemId in interface Result
Parameters:
systemId - The system identifier as a URI string.


"
SAXSource,getInputSource(),InputSource,Get the SAX InputSource to be used for the Source.,"

getInputSource
public InputSource getInputSource()
Get the SAX InputSource to be used for the Source.

Returns:
A valid InputSource reference, or null.


"
SAXSource,getSystemId(),String,Get the base ID (URI or system ID) from where URIs will be resolved.,"

getSystemId
public String getSystemId()
Get the base ID (URI or system ID) from where URIs
 will be resolved.

Specified by:
getSystemId in interface Source
Returns:
Base URL for the Source, or null.


"
SAXSource,getXMLReader(),XMLReader,Get the XMLReader to be used for the Source.,"

getXMLReader
public XMLReader getXMLReader()
Get the XMLReader to be used for the Source.

Returns:
A valid XMLReader or XMLFilter reference, or null.


"
SAXSource,setInputSource(InputSource inputSource),void,Set the SAX InputSource to be used for the Source.,"

setInputSource
public void setInputSource(InputSource inputSource)
Set the SAX InputSource to be used for the Source.

Parameters:
inputSource - A valid InputSource reference.


"
SAXSource,setSystemId(String systemId),void,Set the system identifier for this Source.,"

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(String systemId)
Set the system identifier for this Source.  If an input source
 has already been set, it will set the system ID or that
 input source, otherwise it will create a new input source.

 The system identifier is optional if there is a byte stream
 or a character stream, but it is still useful to provide one,
 since the application can use it to resolve relative URIs
 and can include it in error messages and warnings (the parser
 will attempt to open a connection to the URI only if
 no byte stream or character stream is specified).

Specified by:
setSystemId in interface Source
Parameters:
systemId - The system identifier as a URI string.


"
SAXSource,setXMLReader(XMLReader reader),void,Set the XMLReader to be used for the Source.,"

setXMLReader
public void setXMLReader(XMLReader reader)
Set the XMLReader to be used for the Source.

Parameters:
reader - A valid XMLReader or XMLFilter reference.


"
SAXSource,sourceToInputSource(Source source),static InputSource,Attempt to obtain a SAX InputSource object from a Source object.,"

sourceToInputSource
public static InputSource sourceToInputSource(Source source)
Attempt to obtain a SAX InputSource object from a Source
 object.

Parameters:
source - Must be a non-null Source reference.
Returns:
An InputSource, or null if Source can not be converted.


"
SAXTransformerFactory,newTemplatesHandler(),abstract TemplatesHandler,Get a TemplatesHandler object that can process SAX ContentHandler events into a Templates object.,"

newTemplatesHandler
public abstract TemplatesHandler newTemplatesHandler()
                                              throws TransformerConfigurationException
Get a TemplatesHandler object that can process SAX
 ContentHandler events into a Templates object.

 ContentHandler events into a Result. The transformation
 is defined as an identity (or copy) transformation, for example
 to copy a series of SAX parse events into a DOM tree.

A non-null reference to a TransformerHandler, that may
 be used as a ContentHandler for SAX parse events.
