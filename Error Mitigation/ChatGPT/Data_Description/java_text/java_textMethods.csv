setChoices
public void setChoices(double[] limits,
                       String[] formats)
Set the choices to be used in formatting.

Parameters:
limits - contains the top value that you want
 parsed with that format, and should be in ascending sorted order. When
 formatting X, the choice will be the i, where
 limit[i] ≤ X < limit[i+1].
 If the limit array is not in ascending order, the results of formatting
 will be incorrect.
formats - are the formats you want to use for each limit.
 They can be either Format objects or Strings.
 When formatting with object Y,
 if the object is a NumberFormat, then ((NumberFormat) Y).format(X)
 is called. Otherwise Y.toString() is called.

"
CollationElementIterator,getOffset(),int,Returns the character offset in the original text corresponding to the next collation element.,"

getOffset
public int getOffset()
Returns the character offset in the original text corresponding to the next
 collation element.  (That is, getOffset() returns the position in the text
 corresponding to the collation element that will be returned by the next
 call to next().)  This value will always be the index of the FIRST character
 corresponding to the collation element (a contracting character sequence is
 when two or more characters all correspond to the same collation element).
 This means if you do setOffset(x) followed immediately by getOffset(), getOffset()
 won't necessarily return x.

Returns:
The character offset in the original text corresponding to the collation
 element that will be returned by the next call to next().
Since:
1.2


"
CollationElementIterator,next(),int,Get the next collation element in the string.,"

next
public int next()
Get the next collation element in the string.  This iterator iterates
 over a sequence of collation elements that were built from the string.
 Because there isn't necessarily a one-to-one mapping from characters to
 collation elements, this doesn't mean the same thing as ""return the
 collation element [or ordering priority] of the next character in the
 string"".
This function returns the collation element that the iterator is currently
 pointing to and then updates the internal pointer to point to the next element.
 previous() updates the pointer first and then returns the element.  This
 means that when you change direction while iterating (i.e., call next() and
 then call previous(), or call previous() and then call next()), you'll get
 back the same element twice.

Returns:
the next collation element


"
CollationElementIterator,previous(),int,Get the previous collation element in the string.,"

previous
public int previous()
Get the previous collation element in the string.  This iterator iterates
 over a sequence of collation elements that were built from the string.
 Because there isn't necessarily a one-to-one mapping from characters to
 collation elements, this doesn't mean the same thing as ""return the
 collation element [or ordering priority] of the previous character in the
 string"".
This function updates the iterator's internal pointer to point to the
 collation element preceding the one it's currently pointing to and then
 returns that element, while next() returns the current element and then
 updates the pointer.  This means that when you change direction while
 iterating (i.e., call next() and then call previous(), or call previous()
 and then call next()), you'll get back the same element twice.

Returns:
the previous collation element
Since:
1.2

"
CollationElementIterator,setOffset(int newOffset),void,"Sets the iterator to point to the collation element corresponding to the specified character (the parameter is a CHARACTER offset in the original string, not an offset into its corresponding sequence of collation elements).","

setOffset
public void setOffset(int newOffset)
Sets the iterator to point to the collation element corresponding to
 the specified character (the parameter is a CHARACTER offset in the
 original string, not an offset into its corresponding sequence of
 collation elements).  The value returned by the next call to next()
 will be the collation element corresponding to the specified position
 in the text.  If that position is in the middle of a contracting
 character sequence, the result of the next call to next() is the
 collation element for that sequence.  This means that getOffset()
 is not guaranteed to return the same value as was passed to a preceding
 call to setOffset().

Parameters:
newOffset - The new character offset into the original text.
Since:
1.2

Parse a date/time string according to the given parse position.  For
 example, a time text ""07/10/96 4:5 PM, PDT"" will be parsed into a Date
 that is equivalent to Date(837039900000L).

  By default, parsing is lenient: If the input is not in the form used
 by this object's format method but can still be parsed as a date, then
 the parse succeeds.  Clients may insist on strict adherence to the
 format by calling setLenient(false).

 This parsing operation uses the calendar to produce
 a Date. As a result, the calendar's date-time
 fields and the TimeZone value may have been
 overwritten, depending on subclass implementations. Any TimeZone value that has previously been set by a call to
 setTimeZone may need
 to be restored for further operations.

Parameters:
source - The date/time string to be parsed

"
DateFormat,"parseObject(String source, ParsePosition pos)",Object,Parses text from a string to produce a Date.,"

parseObject
public Object parseObject(String source,
                          ParsePosition pos)
Parses text from a string to produce a Date.
 
 The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by
 pos.
 If parsing succeeds, then the index of pos is updated
 to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
 use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
 date is returned. The updated pos can be used to
 indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
 If an error occurs, then the index of pos is not
 changed, the error index of pos is set to the index of
 the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.
 
 See the parse(String, ParsePosition) method for more information
 on date parsing.

Specified by:
parseObject in class Format
Parameters:
source - A String, part of which should be parsed.
pos - A ParsePosition object with index and error
            index information as described above.
Returns:
A Date parsed from the string. In case of
         error, returns null.
Throws:
NullPointerException - if pos is null.


"
DateFormat,setCalendar(Calendar newCalendar),void,Set the calendar to be used by this date format.,"

setCalendar
public void setCalendar(Calendar newCalendar)
Set the calendar to be used by this date format.  Initially, the default
 calendar for the specified or default locale is used.

 Any TimeZone and leniency values that have previously been set are
 overwritten by newCalendar's values.

newCalendar - the new Calendar to be used by the date format


"
DateFormat,setLenient(boolean lenient),void,Specify whether or not date/time parsing is to be lenient.,"

setLenient
public void setLenient(boolean lenient)
Specify whether or not date/time parsing is to be lenient.  With
 lenient parsing, the parser may use heuristics to interpret inputs that
 do not precisely match this object's format.  With strict parsing,
 inputs must match this object's format.

 This method is equivalent to the following call.
 
 getCalendar().setLenient(lenient)
 
This leniency value is overwritten by a call to setCalendar().

Parameters:
lenient - when true, parsing is lenient

Apply the given pattern to this Format object.  The pattern
 is assumed to be in a localized notation. A pattern is a
 short-hand specification for the various formatting properties.
 These properties can also be changed individually through the
 various setter methods.
 
 There is no limit to integer digits set
 by this routine, since that is the typical end-user desire;
 use setMaximumInteger if you want to set a real value.
 For negative numbers, use a second pattern, separated by a semicolon
 Example ""#,#00.0#"" → 1,234.56
 This means a minimum of 2 integer digits, 1 fraction digit, and
 a maximum of 2 fraction digits.
 Example: ""#,#00.0#;(#,#00.0#)"" for negatives in
 parentheses.
 In negative patterns, the minimum and maximum counts are ignored;
 these are presumed to be set in the positive pattern.

Parameters:
pattern - a new pattern

DecimalFormat,"parse(String text, ParsePosition pos)",Number,Parses text from a string to produce a Number.,"

parse
public Number parse(String text,
                    ParsePosition pos)
Parses text from a string to produce a Number.
 
 The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by
 pos.
 If parsing succeeds, then the index of pos is updated
 to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
 use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
 number is returned. The updated pos can be used to
 indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
 If an error occurs, then the index of pos is not
 changed, the error index of pos is set to the index of
 the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.
 
 The subclass returned depends on the value of isParseBigDecimal()
 as well as on the string being parsed.
 
If isParseBigDecimal() is false (the default),
       most integer values are returned as Long
       objects, no matter how they are written: ""17"" and
       ""17.000"" both parse to Long(17).
       Values that cannot fit into a Long are returned as
       Doubles. This includes values with a fractional part,
       infinite values, NaN, and the value -0.0.
       DecimalFormat does not decide whether to
       return a Double or a Long based on the
       presence of a decimal separator in the source string. Doing so
       would prevent integers that overflow the mantissa of a double,
       such as ""-9,223,372,036,854,775,808.00"", from being
       parsed accurately.
       
       Callers may use the Number methods
       doubleValue, longValue, etc., to obtain
       the type they want.

 to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
 use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
 object is returned. The updated pos can be used to
 indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
 If an error occurs, then the index of pos is not
 changed, the error index of pos is set to the index of
 the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

Parameters:
source - A String, part of which should be parsed.
pos - A ParsePosition object with index and error
            index information as described above.
Returns:
An Object parsed from the string. In case of

format
public static String format(String pattern,
                            Object... arguments)
Creates a MessageFormat with the given pattern and uses it
 to format the given arguments. This is equivalent to
 
(new MessageFormat(pattern)).format(arguments, new StringBuffer(), null).toString()


Parameters:
pattern - the pattern string
arguments - object(s) to format
Returns:
the formatted string
Throws:
IllegalArgumentException - if the pattern is invalid,
            or if an argument in the arguments array

            that use it.


"
MessageFormat,formatToCharacterIterator(Object arguments),AttributedCharacterIterator,"Formats an array of objects and inserts them into the MessageFormat's pattern, producing an AttributedCharacterIterator.","

formatToCharacterIterator
public AttributedCharacterIterator formatToCharacterIterator(Object arguments)
Formats an array of objects and inserts them into the
 MessageFormat's pattern, producing an
 AttributedCharacterIterator.
 You can use the returned AttributedCharacterIterator
 to build the resulting String, as well as to determine information
 about the resulting String.
 
 The text of the returned AttributedCharacterIterator is
 the same that would be returned by
 
format(arguments, new StringBuffer(), null).toString()


 In addition, the AttributedCharacterIterator contains at
 least attributes indicating where text was generated from an
 argument in the arguments array. The keys of these attributes are of
 type MessageFormat.Field, their values are
 Integer objects indicating the index in the arguments
 array of the argument from which the text was generated.
 
 The attributes/value from the underlying Format
 instances that MessageFormat uses will also be
 placed in the resulting AttributedCharacterIterator.
 This allows you to not only find where an argument is placed in the
 resulting String, but also which fields it contains in turn.

Overrides:
formatToCharacterIterator in class Format
Parameters:
arguments - an array of objects to be formatted and substituted.
Returns:
AttributedCharacterIterator describing the formatted value.
Throws:
NullPointerException - if arguments is null.
IllegalArgumentException - if an argument in the
            arguments array is not of the type
            expected by the format element(s) that use it.

"
MessageFormat,getFormats(),Format[],Gets the formats used for the format elements in the previously set pattern string.,"

getFormats
public Format[] getFormats()
Gets the formats used for the format elements in the
 previously set pattern string.
 The order of formats in the returned array corresponds to
 the order of format elements in the pattern string.
 
 Since the order of format elements in a pattern string often
 changes during localization, it's generally better to use the
 getFormatsByArgumentIndex
 method, which assumes an order of formats corresponding to the
 order of elements in the arguments array passed to
 the format methods or the result array returned by
 the parse methods.

Returns:
the formats used for the format elements in the pattern


"
MessageFormat,getFormatsByArgumentIndex(),Format[],Gets the formats used for the values passed into format methods or returned from parse methods.,"

getFormatsByArgumentIndex
public Format[] getFormatsByArgumentIndex()
Gets the formats used for the values passed into
 format methods or returned from parse
 methods. The indices of elements in the returned array
 correspond to the argument indices used in the previously set
 pattern string.
 The order of formats in the returned array thus corresponds to
 the order of elements in the arguments array passed
 to the format methods or the result array returned
 by the parse methods.
 
 If an argument index is used for more than one format element
 in the pattern string, then the format used for the last such
 format element is returned in the array. If an argument index
 is not used for any format element in the pattern string, then
 null is returned in the array.

Returns:
the formats used for the arguments within the pattern
Since:
1.4


"
MessageFormat,getLocale(),Locale,Gets the locale that's used when creating or comparing subformats.,"

getLocale
public Locale getLocale()
Gets the locale that's used when creating or comparing subformats.

Returns:
the locale used when creating or comparing subformats


"
MessageFormat,hashCode(),int,Generates a hash code for the message format object.,"

hashCode
public int hashCode()
Generates a hash code for the message format object.

Overrides:
hashCode in class Object
Returns:
a hash code value for this object.
See Also:
Object.equals(java.lang.Object), 
System.identityHashCode(java.lang.Object)


"
MessageFormat,parse(String source),Object[],Parses text from the beginning of the given string to produce an object array.,"

parse
public Object[] parse(String source)
               throws ParseException
Parses text from the beginning of the given string to produce an object
 array.
 The method may not use the entire text of the given string.
 
 See the parse(String, ParsePosition) method for more information
 on message parsing.

Parameters:
source - A String whose beginning should be parsed.
Returns:
An Object array parsed from the string.
Throws:
ParseException - if the beginning of the specified string
            cannot be parsed.


"
MessageFormat,"parse(String source, ParsePosition pos)",Object[],Parses the string.,"

parse
public Object[] parse(String source,
                      ParsePosition pos)
Parses the string.

 Caveats: The parse may fail in a number of circumstances.
 For example:
 
If one of the arguments does not occur in the pattern.
 If the format of an argument loses information, such as
     with a choice format where a large number formats to ""many"".
 Does not yet handle recursion (where
     the substituted strings contain {n} references.)
 Will not always find a match (or the correct match)
     if some part of the parse is ambiguous.
     For example, if the pattern ""{1},{2}"" is used with the
     string arguments {""a,b"", ""c""}, it will format as ""a,b,c"".
     When the result is parsed, it will return {""a"", ""b,c""}.
 If a single argument is parsed more than once in the string,
     then the later parse wins.
 
 When the parse fails, use ParsePosition.getErrorIndex() to find out
 where in the string the parsing failed.  The returned error
 index is the starting offset of the sub-patterns that the string
 is comparing with.  For example, if the parsing string ""AAA {0} BBB""
 is comparing against the pattern ""AAD {0} BBB"", the error index is
 0. When an error occurs, the call to this method will return null.
 If the source is null, return an empty array.

Parameters:
source - the string to parse
pos - the parse position
Returns:
an array of parsed objects


"
MessageFormat,"parseObject(String source, ParsePosition pos)",Object,Parses text from a string to produce an object array.,"

parseObject
public Object parseObject(String source,
                          ParsePosition pos)
Parses text from a string to produce an object array.
 
 The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by
 pos.
 If parsing succeeds, then the index of pos is updated
 to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
 use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
 object array is returned. The updated pos can be used to
 indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
 If an error occurs, then the index of pos is not
 changed, the error index of pos is set to the index of
 the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.
 
 See the parse(String, ParsePosition) method for more information
 on message parsing.

Specified by:
parseObject in class Format
Parameters:
source - A String, part of which should be parsed.
pos - A ParsePosition object with index and error
            index information as described above.
Returns:
An Object array parsed from the string. In case of
         error, returns null.
Throws:
NullPointerException - if pos is null.


"
MessageFormat,"setFormat(int formatElementIndex, Format newFormat)",void,Sets the format to use for the format element with the given format element index within the previously set pattern string.,"

setFormat
public void setFormat(int formatElementIndex,
                      Format newFormat)
Sets the format to use for the format element with the given
 format element index within the previously set pattern string.
 The format element index is the zero-based number of the format
 element counting from the start of the pattern string.
 
 Since the order of format elements in a pattern string often
 changes during localization, it is generally better to use the
 setFormatByArgumentIndex
 method, which accesses format elements based on the argument
 index they specify.

Parameters:
formatElementIndex - the index of a format element within the pattern
newFormat - the format to use for the specified format element
Throws:
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException - if formatElementIndex is equal to or
            larger than the number of format elements in the pattern string


"
MessageFormat,"setFormatByArgumentIndex(int argumentIndex, Format newFormat)",void,Sets the format to use for the format elements within the previously set pattern string that use the given argument index.,"

setFormatByArgumentIndex
public void setFormatByArgumentIndex(int argumentIndex,
                                     Format newFormat)
Sets the format to use for the format elements within the
 previously set pattern string that use the given argument
 index.
 The argument index is part of the format element definition and
 represents an index into the arguments array passed
 to the format methods or the result array returned
 by the parse methods.
 
 If the argument index is used for more than one format element
 in the pattern string, then the new format is used for all such
 format elements. If the argument index is not used for any format
 element in the pattern string, then the new format is ignored.

Parameters:
argumentIndex - the argument index for which to use the new format
newFormat - the new format to use
Since:
1.4


"
MessageFormat,setFormats(Format[] newFormats),void,Sets the formats to use for the format elements in the previously set pattern string.,"

setFormats
public void setFormats(Format[] newFormats)
Sets the formats to use for the format elements in the
 previously set pattern string.
 The order of formats in newFormats corresponds to
 the order of format elements in the pattern string.
 
 If more formats are provided than needed by the pattern string,
 the remaining ones are ignored. If fewer formats are provided
 than needed, then only the first newFormats.length
 formats are replaced.
 
 Since the order of format elements in a pattern string often
 changes during localization, it is generally better to use the
 setFormatsByArgumentIndex
 method, which assumes an order of formats corresponding to the
 order of elements in the arguments array passed to
 the format methods or the result array returned by
 the parse methods.

Parameters:
newFormats - the new formats to use
Throws:
NullPointerException - if newFormats is null


"
MessageFormat,setFormatsByArgumentIndex(Format[] newFormats),void,Sets the formats to use for the values passed into format methods or returned from parse methods.,"

setFormatsByArgumentIndex
public void setFormatsByArgumentIndex(Format[] newFormats)
Sets the formats to use for the values passed into
 format methods or returned from parse
 methods. The indices of elements in newFormats
 correspond to the argument indices used in the previously set
 pattern string.
 The order of formats in newFormats thus corresponds to
 the order of elements in the arguments array passed
 to the format methods or the result array returned
 by the parse methods.
 
 If an argument index is used for more than one format element
 in the pattern string, then the corresponding new format is used
 for all such format elements. If an argument index is not used
 for any format element in the pattern string, then the
 corresponding new format is ignored. If fewer formats are provided
 than needed, then only the formats for argument indices less
 than newFormats.length are replaced.

Parameters:
newFormats - the new formats to use
Throws:
NullPointerException - if newFormats is null
Since:
1.4


"
MessageFormat,setLocale(Locale locale),void,Sets the locale to be used when creating or comparing subformats.,"

setLocale
public void setLocale(Locale locale)
Sets the locale to be used when creating or comparing subformats.
 This affects subsequent calls
 
to the applyPattern
     and toPattern methods if format elements specify
     a format type and therefore have the subformats created in the
     applyPattern method, as well as
 to the format and
     formatToCharacterIterator methods
     if format elements do not specify a format type and therefore have
     the subformats created in the formatting methods.
 
 Subformats that have already been created are not affected.

Parameters:
locale - the locale to be used when creating or comparing subformats


"
MessageFormat,toPattern(),String,Returns a pattern representing the current state of the message format.,"

toPattern
public String toPattern()
Returns a pattern representing the current state of the message format.
 The string is constructed from internal information and therefore
 does not necessarily equal the previously applied pattern.

Returns:
a pattern representing the current state of the message format


"
MessageFormat.Field,readResolve(),protected Object,Resolves instances being deserialized to the predefined constants.,"

readResolve
protected Object readResolve()
                      throws InvalidObjectException
Resolves instances being deserialized to the predefined constants.

Overrides:
readResolve in class AttributedCharacterIterator.Attribute

                           StringBuffer toAppendTo,
                           FieldPosition pos)
Formats a number and appends the resulting text to the given string
 buffer.
 The number can be of any subclass of Number.
 
 This implementation extracts the number's value using
 Number.longValue() for all integral type values that
 can be converted to long without loss of information,
 including BigInteger values with a
 bit length of less than 64,
 and Number.doubleValue() for all other types. It
 then calls
 format(long,java.lang.StringBuffer,java.text.FieldPosition)

parseObject
public final Object parseObject(String source,
                                ParsePosition pos)
Parses text from a string to produce a Number.
 
 The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by
 pos.
 If parsing succeeds, then the index of pos is updated
 to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
 use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
 number is returned. The updated pos can be used to
 indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
 If an error occurs, then the index of pos is not
 changed, the error index of pos is set to the index of
 the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.
 
 See the parse(String, ParsePosition) method for more information
 on number parsing.

Specified by:
parseObject in class Format
Parameters:
source - A String, part of which should be parsed.
pos - A ParsePosition object with index and error
            index information as described above.
Returns:
A Number parsed from the string. In case of
         error, returns null.

"
SimpleDateFormat,"parse(String text, ParsePosition pos)",Date,Parses text from a string to produce a Date.,"

parse
public Date parse(String text,
                  ParsePosition pos)
Parses text from a string to produce a Date.
 
 The method attempts to parse text starting at the index given by
 pos.
 If parsing succeeds, then the index of pos is updated
 to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily
 use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed
 date is returned. The updated pos can be used to
 indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
 If an error occurs, then the index of pos is not
 changed, the error index of pos is set to the index of
 the character where the error occurred, and null is returned.

 This parsing operation uses the calendar to produce a Date. All of the calendar's date-time fields are cleared before parsing, and the calendar's default
 values of the date-time fields are used for any missing
 date-time information. For example, the year value of the
 parsed Date is 1970 with GregorianCalendar if
 no year value is given from the parsing operation.  The TimeZone value may be overwritten, depending on the given
 pattern and the time zone value in text. Any TimeZone value that has previously been set by a call to
 setTimeZone may need
 to be restored for further operations.

Specified by:
parse in class DateFormat
Parameters:
text - A String, part of which should be parsed.
pos - A ParsePosition object with index and error
              index information as described above.
Returns:
A Date parsed from the string. In case of
