                               throws RemoteException
Creates and exports a Registry instance on the local
 host that accepts requests on the specified port.

 The Registry instance is exported as if the static
 UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject method is invoked, passing the
 Registry instance and the specified port as
 arguments, except that the Registry instance is
 exported with a well-known object identifier, an ObjID
 instance constructed with the value ObjID.REGISTRY_ID.

Parameters:
port - the port on which the registry accepts requests
Returns:

createRegistry
public static Registry createRegistry(int port,
                                      RMIClientSocketFactory csf,
                                      RMIServerSocketFactory ssf)
                               throws RemoteException
Creates and exports a Registry instance on the local
 host that uses custom socket factories for communication with that
 instance.  The registry that is created listens for incoming
 requests on the given port using a
 ServerSocket created from the supplied
 RMIServerSocketFactory.

 The Registry instance is exported as if
 the static UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject method is invoked, passing the
 Registry instance, the specified port, the
 specified RMIClientSocketFactory, and the specified
 RMIServerSocketFactory as arguments, except that the
 Registry instance is exported with a well-known object
 identifier, an ObjID instance constructed with the value
 ObjID.REGISTRY_ID.

Parameters:
port - port on which the registry accepts requests
csf - client-side Socket factory used to
      make connections to the registry
ssf - server-side ServerSocket factory
      used to accept connections to the registry
Returns:
the registry
Throws:
RemoteException - if the registry could not be exported

                            throws RemoteException
Returns a reference to the remote object Registry on the
 specified host on the default registry port of 1099.  If
 host is null, the local host is used.

Parameters:
host - host for the remote registry
Returns:
reference (a stub) to the remote object registry
Throws:
RemoteException - if the reference could not be created
Since:
