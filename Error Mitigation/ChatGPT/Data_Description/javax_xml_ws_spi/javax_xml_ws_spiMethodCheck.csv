createEndpoint
public abstract Endpoint createEndpoint(String bindingId,
                                        Object implementor)
Creates an endpoint object with the provided binding and implementation
 object.

Parameters:
bindingId - A URI specifying the desired binding (e.g. SOAP/HTTP)
implementor - A service implementation object to which
        incoming requests will be dispatched. The corresponding
        class MUST be annotated with all the necessary Web service
        annotations.
Returns:
The newly created endpoint.

Creates an endpoint object with the provided binding, implementation
 object and web service features. Provider implementations
 must override the default implementation.

Parameters:
bindingId - A URI specifying the desired binding (e.g. SOAP/HTTP)
implementor - A service implementation object to which
        incoming requests will be dispatched. The corresponding
        class MUST be annotated with all the necessary Web service
        annotations.
features - A list of WebServiceFeatures to configure on the
        endpoint.  Supported features not in the features
         parameter will have their default values.
Returns:
The newly created endpoint.

getExecutor
public abstract Executor getExecutor()
Returns the executor for this Serviceinstance.

 The executor is used for all asynchronous invocations that
 require callbacks.

Returns:
The java.util.concurrent.Executor to be
         used to invoke a callback.

setExecutor
public abstract void setExecutor(Executor executor)
Sets the executor for this Service instance.

 The executor is used for all asynchronous invocations that
 require callbacks.

Parameters:
executor - The java.util.concurrent.Executor
        to be used to invoke a callback.
Throws:
SecurityException - If the instance does not support
         setting an executor for security reasons (e.g. the
         necessary permissions are missing).

2,ServiceDelegate,5,void setHandlerResolver(HandlerResolver handlerResolver),True,,"

setHandlerResolver
public abstract void setHandlerResolver(HandlerResolver handlerResolver)
Sets the HandlerResolver for this Service
 instance.
 
 The handler resolver, if present, will be called once for each
 proxy or dispatch instance that is created, and the handler chain
 returned by the resolver will be set on the instance.

Parameters:
handlerResolver - The HandlerResolver to use
        for all subsequently created proxy/dispatch objects.
