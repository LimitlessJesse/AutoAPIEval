getXMLStreamWriter
public XMLStreamWriter getXMLStreamWriter()
Get the XMLStreamWriter used by this
 StAXResult.
XMLStreamWriter will be null
 if this StAXResult was created with a
 XMLEventWriter.

Returns:
XMLStreamWriter used by this
   StAXResult.

0,StAXResult,2,void setSystemId(String systemId),True,,"

setSystemId
public void setSystemId(String systemId)
In the context of a StAXResult, it is not appropriate
 to explicitly set the system identifier.
 The XMLEventWriter or XMLStreamWriter
 used to construct this StAXResult determines the
 system identifier of the XML result.
An UnsupportedOperationException is always
 thrown by this method.

Specified by:
setSystemId in interface Result
Parameters:
systemId - Ignored.
Throws:
UnsupportedOperationException - Is always
   thrown by this method.
