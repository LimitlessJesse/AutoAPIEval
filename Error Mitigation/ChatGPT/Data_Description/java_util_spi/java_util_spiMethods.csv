LocaleServiceProvider,getAvailableLocales(),abstract Locale[],Returns an array of all locales for which this locale service provider can provide localized objects or names.,"

getAvailableLocales
public abstract Locale[] getAvailableLocales()
Returns an array of all locales for which this locale service provider
 can provide localized objects or names. This information is used to
 compose getAvailableLocales() values of the locale-dependent
 services, such as DateFormat.getAvailableLocales().

 The array returned by this method should not include two or more
 Locale objects only differing in their extensions.

Returns:
An array of all locales for which this locale service provider
 can provide localized objects or names.


"
LocaleServiceProvider,isSupportedLocale(Locale locale),boolean,Returns true if the given locale is supported by this locale service provider.,"

isSupportedLocale
public boolean isSupportedLocale(Locale locale)
Returns true if the given locale is supported by
 this locale service provider. The given locale may contain
 extensions that should be
 taken into account for the support determination.

 The default implementation returns true if the given locale
 is equal to any of the available Locales returned by
 getAvailableLocales() with ignoring any extensions in both the
 given locale and the available locales. Concrete locale service
 provider implementations should override this method if those
 implementations are Locale extensions-aware. For example,
 DecimalFormatSymbolsProvider implementations will need to check
 extensions in the given locale to see if any numbering system is
 specified and can be supported. However, CollatorProvider
 implementations may not be affected by any particular numbering systems,
 and in that case, extensions for numbering systems should be ignored.

Parameters:
locale - a Locale to be tested
Returns:
true if the given locale is supported by this
         provider; false otherwise.
Throws:
NullPointerException - if the given locale is null
Since:
1.8

                                      Locale locale)
Returns a name for the given time zone ID that's suitable for
 presentation to the user in the specified locale. The given time
 zone ID is ""GMT"" or one of the names defined using ""Zone"" entries
 in the ""tz database"", a public domain time zone database at
 ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/.
 The data of this database is contained in a file whose name starts with
 ""tzdata"", and the specification of the data format is part of the zic.8
 man page, which is contained in a file whose name starts with ""tzcode"".

 appropriate for daylight saving time even if the specified time zone
 has not observed daylight saving time in the past.

Parameters:

Returns a generic name for the given time zone ID that's suitable
 for presentation to the user in the specified locale. Generic
 time zone names are neutral from standard time and daylight saving
 time. For example, ""PT"" is the short generic name of time zone ID America/Los_Angeles, while its short standard time and daylight saving
 time names are ""PST"" and ""PDT"", respectively. Refer to
 getDisplayName
 for valid time zone IDs.

 The default implementation of this method returns null.

Parameters:
ID - a time zone ID string
style - either TimeZone.LONG or
    TimeZone.SHORT
locale - the desired locale
Returns:
the human-readable generic name of the given time zone in the
