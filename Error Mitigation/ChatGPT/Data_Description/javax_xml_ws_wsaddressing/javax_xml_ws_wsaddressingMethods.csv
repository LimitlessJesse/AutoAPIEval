address - The address of the endpoint to be targeted
      by the returned W3CEndpointReference.
Returns:
A W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder instance with
   the address set to the wsa:Address.

                                             String value)
Adds an extension attribute to the
 W3CEndpointReference instance's
 wsa:EndpointReference element.

Parameters:
name - The name of the extension attribute to be added to the
   W3CEndpointReference
value - extension attribute value
Returns:
A W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder instance with
   the extension attribute added to the W3CEndpointReference

"
W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder,build(),W3CEndpointReference,Builds a W3CEndpointReference from the accumulated properties set on this W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder instance.,"

build
public W3CEndpointReference build()
Builds a W3CEndpointReference from the accumulated
 properties set on this W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder
 instance.
 
 This method can be used to create a W3CEndpointReference
 for any endpoint by specifying the address property along
 with any other desired properties.  This method
 can also be used to create a W3CEndpointReference for
 an endpoint that is published by the same Java EE application.
 This method can automatically determine the address of
 an endpoint published by the same Java EE application that is identified by the
 serviceName and
 endpointName properties.  If the address is
 null and the serviceName and
 endpointName
 do not identify an endpoint published by the same Java EE application, a
 java.lang.IllegalStateException MUST be thrown.

Returns:
W3CEndpointReference from the accumulated
 properties set on this W3CEndpointReferenceBuilder
 instance. This method never returns null.
Throws:
IllegalStateException - 
If the address, serviceName and
            endpointName are all null.
        If the serviceName service is null and the
            endpointName is NOT null.
        If the address property is null and
            the serviceName and endpointName do not
            specify a valid endpoint published by the same Java EE
            application.
        If the serviceName is NOT null
             and is not present in the specified WSDL.
        If the endpointName port is not null and it
             is not present in serviceName service in the WSDL.
        If the wsdlDocumentLocation is NOT null
            and does not represent a valid WSDL.
     
WebServiceException - If an error occurs while creating the
                             W3CEndpointReference.
