ChannelBinding,hashCode(),int,Returns a hashcode value for this ChannelBinding object.
GSSManager,"addProviderAtEnd(Provider p, Oid mech)",abstract void,This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the application would like a particular provider to be used if no other provider can be found that supports the given mechanism.
GSSManager,"addProviderAtFront(Provider p, Oid mech)",abstract void,This method is used to indicate to the GSSManager that the application would like a particular provider to be used ahead of all others when support is desired for the given mechanism.
GSSManager,createContext(byte[] interProcessToken),abstract GSSContext,Factory method for creating a previously exported context.
GSSManager,createContext(GSSCredential myCred),abstract GSSContext,Factory method for creating a context on the acceptor' side.
GSSManager,"createContext(GSSName peer, Oid mech, GSSCredential myCred, int lifetime)",abstract GSSContext,Factory method for creating a context on the initiator's side.
GSSManager,"createCredential(GSSName name, int lifetime, Oid[] mechs, int usage)",abstract GSSCredential,Factory method for acquiring credentials over a set of mechanisms.
GSSManager,"createCredential(GSSName name, int lifetime, Oid mech, int usage)",abstract GSSCredential,Factory method for acquiring a single mechanism credential.
GSSManager,createCredential(int usage),abstract GSSCredential,Factory method for acquiring default credentials.
GSSManager,"createName(byte[] name, Oid nameType)",abstract GSSName,Factory method to convert a byte array containing a name from the specified namespace to a GSSName object.
GSSManager,"createName(byte[] name, Oid nameType, Oid mech)",abstract GSSName,Factory method to convert a byte array containing a name from the specified namespace to a GSSName object and canonicalize it at the same time for a mechanism.
GSSManager,"createName(String nameStr, Oid nameType)",abstract GSSName,Factory method to convert a string name from the specified namespace to a GSSName object.
GSSManager,"createName(String nameStr, Oid nameType, Oid mech)",abstract GSSName,Factory method to convert a string name from the specified namespace to a GSSName object and canonicalize it at the same time for a mechanism.
GSSManager,getInstance(),static GSSManager,Returns the default GSSManager implementation.
GSSManager,getMechs(),abstract Oid[],Returns a list of mechanisms that are available to GSS-API callers through this GSSManager.
GSSManager,getMechsForName(Oid nameType),abstract Oid[],Returns a list of mechanisms that support the indicated name type.
GSSManager,getNamesForMech(Oid mech),abstract Oid[],Returns then name types supported by the indicated mechanism.
MessageProp,getMinorStatus(),int,Retrieves the minor status code that the underlying mechanism might have set for this per-message operation.
MessageProp,getMinorString(),String,Retrieves a string explaining the minor status code.
MessageProp,getPrivacy(),boolean,Retrieves the privacy state.
MessageProp,getQOP(),int,Retrieves the QOP value.
MessageProp,isDuplicateToken(),boolean,Tests if this is a duplicate of an earlier token.
MessageProp,isGapToken(),boolean,"Tests if an expected token was not received, i.e., one or more predecessor tokens have not yet been successfully processed."
MessageProp,isOldToken(),boolean,"Tests if this token's validity period has expired, i.e., the token is too old to be checked for duplication."
MessageProp,isUnseqToken(),boolean,Tests if a later token had already been processed.
MessageProp,setPrivacy(boolean privState),void,Sets the privacy state.
MessageProp,setQOP(int qop),void,Sets the QOP value.
MessageProp,"setSupplementaryStates(boolean duplicate, boolean old, boolean unseq, boolean gap, int minorStatus, String minorString)",void,This method sets the state for the supplementary information flags and the minor status in MessageProp.
Oid,containedIn(Oid[] oids),boolean,A utility method to test if this Oid value is contained within the supplied Oid array.
Oid,equals(Object other),boolean,Tests if two Oid objects represent the same Object identifier value.
Oid,getDER(),byte[],"Returns the full ASN.1 DER encoding for this oid object, which includes the tag and length."
Oid,hashCode(),int,Returns a hashcode value for this Oid.
Oid,toString(),String,Returns a string representation of the oid's integer components in dot separated notation.
