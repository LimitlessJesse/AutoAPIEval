Sample: 1 StreamSource
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. `void setInputStream(InputStream inputStream)`: This method sets the input stream that is used as the source of the transformation.
   
2. `void setReader(Reader reader)`: This method sets the reader that is used as the source of the transformation.
   
3. `void setSystemId(String systemId)`: This method sets the system ID for this StreamSource.
   
4. `InputStream getInputStream()`: This method returns the input stream that is used as the source of the transformation.
   
5. `Reader getReader()`: This method returns the reader that is used as the source of the transformation.
