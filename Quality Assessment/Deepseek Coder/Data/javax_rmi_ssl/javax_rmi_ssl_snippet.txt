I want to learn how to use boolean equals(Object obj) from javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIClientSocketFactory
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

The `equals(Object obj)` method in the `SslRMIClientSocketFactory` class is used to compare the equality of two objects. It is a boolean method that returns true if the two objects are equal and false if they are not.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `equals(Object obj)` method from the `SslRMIClientSocketFactory` class:

```java
import javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIClientSocketFactory;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.Socket;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        SslRMIClientSocketFactory sslRMIClientSocketFactory1 = new SslRMIClientSocketFactory();
        SslRMIClientSocketFactory sslRMIClientSocketFactory2 = new SslRMIClientSocketFactory();

        Socket socket1 = new Socket(sslRMIClientSocketFactory1);
        Socket socket2 = new Socket(sslRMIClientSocketFactory2);

        boolean isEqual = socket1.equals(socket2);

        System.out.println("Are the two SslRMIClientSocketFactory objects equal? " + isEqual);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, two `SslRMIClientSocketFactory` objects are created and compared using the `equals(Object obj)` method. The result is printed to the console.

Please note that the `equals(Object obj)` method in the `SslRMIClientSocketFactory` class is not used to compare the equality of two `Socket` objects. The `equals(Object obj)` method in the `Socket` class is used for this purpose.

Also, the `SslRMIClientSocketFactory` class is not part of the standard Java API and is likely a part of a specific library or framework. The code provided here is a general example of how to use the `equals(Object obj)` method and may not work in a standard Java environment.

I want to learn how to use int hashCode() from javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIClientSocketFactory

The `hashCode()` method in the `SslRMIClientSocketFactory` class is part of the Java API and it is used to get the hash code of the object. The hash code is a unique integer value that is used to identify the object in a hash-based collection.

Here is the code snippet:

```java
import javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIClientSocketFactory;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SslRMIClientSocketFactory sslRMIClientSocketFactory = new SslRMIClientSocketFactory();
        System.out.println(sslRMIClientSocketFactory.hashCode());
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create an instance of `SslRMIClientSocketFactory` and then call the `hashCode()` method on it. The hash code of the object is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `hashCode()` method in the `SslRMIClientSocketFactory` class is not overridden in the standard Java API, so it will return a different hash code for each instance of the class.

Also, the `SslRMIClientSocketFactory` class is part of the Java API for RMI (Remote Method Invocation), which is used for communication between Java applications running on different machines. It is not typically used in everyday programming.

If you are looking for a way to generate a hash code in Java, you might want to look into the `Objects.hash()` method, which can be used to generate a hash code for multiple values.

Here is a code snippet that uses the `createSocket(String host, int port)` method from `javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIClientSocketFactory`:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.rmi.ssl.SslRMIClientSocketFactory;
import java.net.Socket;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            SslRMIClientSocketFactory sslFactory = new SslRMIClientSocketFactory();
            Socket socket = sslFactory.createSocket("example.com", 443);
            System.out.println("Socket created successfully!");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("Failed to create socket: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first import the necessary classes. Then, we create an instance of `SslRMIClientSocketFactory`. After that, we call the `createSocket(String host, int port)` method on this instance, passing in the hostname and port number of the server we want to connect to. If the socket is successfully created, we print a success message. If an IOException occurs, we print an error message.

Please replace "example.com" and 443 with your actual host and port.

Note: The `SslRMIClientSocketFactory` class is part of the Java API for RMI (Remote Method Invocation), and it's used for creating SSL-enabled sockets. If you're not using RMI, you might not need to use this class.
