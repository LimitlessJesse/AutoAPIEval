Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.imageio.stream.FileCacheImageInputStream` package:

1. `int read()`: This method reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned.

2. `int read(byte[] b)`: This method reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the byte array `b`. The number of bytes read is returned as an integer.

3. `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method reads up to `len` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. The number of bytes read is returned as an integer.

4. `long skip(long n)`: This method skips over and discards `n` bytes of data from the input stream. The actual number of bytes skipped is returned.

5. `int available()`: This method returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next caller of the `read()` method.

Note: The `read()` method returns an `int`, which is the next byte of data, or -1 if the end of the stream is reached. The `read(byte[] b)` and `read(byte[] b, int off, int len)` methods return an `int`, which is the number of bytes actually read.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.imageio.stream.FileCacheImageOutputStream` package:

1. `void close()`: This method closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with it.

2. `void flush()`: This method flushes the stream.

3. `int read()`: This method reads the next byte of data from the input stream.

4. `int read(byte[] b)`: This method reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array `b`.

5. `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method reads up to `len` bytes of data from the input stream into the buffer array `b` starting at offset `off`.

Note: The return type of these methods is `int` for `read()` and `read(byte[] b)`, and `void` for `close()` and `flush()`. The parameters for `read(byte[] b, int off, int len)` are `byte[] b` (the buffer into which the data is read), `int off` (the start offset in the buffer), and `int len` (the maximum number of bytes to read).

Remember to always close the `FileImageInputStream` after you're done with it to free up system resources.

```java
FileImageInputStream input = new FileImageInputStream(new File("path_to_your_file"));
// use the input stream
input.close();
```

This will ensure that the underlying file is properly closed and any system resources are released.
