For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler` package:

1. `public void setFormatter(Formatter formatter)`: This method sets the formatter for this handler. The formatter is used to format the log records as text.

2. `public Formatter getFormatter()`: This method returns the formatter for this handler.

3. `public void setOutputStream(OutputStream out)`: This method sets the output stream for this handler.

4. `public OutputStream getOutputStream()`: This method returns the output stream for this handler.

5. `public synchronized void publish(LogRecord record)`: This method is used to publish a log record. It is called by the logging framework to deliver log records to the handler.

Note: The `Formatter` and `OutputStream` classes are part of the `java.util.logging` package, and the `LogRecord` class is also part of the `java.util.logging` package.

Remember, the `ConsoleHandler` class is a subclass of the `StreamHandler` class, which in turn is a subclass of the `Handler` class. Therefore, it inherits all methods from its parent classes, but the API methods listed above are specific to the `ConsoleHandler` class.

5. `public void close()`: This method closes the stream and releases any system resources that it may be using.

Note: The methods `publish`, `flush`, and `close` inherent from their parent class `java.util.logging.Handler` are not included in the list.

Remember, the return type and parameters of these methods are not specified in the question, so I've left them blank.

Also, it's important to note that the `java.util.logging.FileHandler` package is part of the Java standard logging API, and it's not a part of the Java Collections Framework.

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.util.logging.Level` package:

1. `public static Level parse(String s)`: This method parses a string to create a level. The string should be the name of a predefined level.

2. `public String getName()`: This method returns the name of this level.

3. `public int intValue()`: This method returns the integer value of this level.

4. `public static Level toLevel(String s)`: This method converts a string to a level.

5. `public static Level toLevel(int val)`: This method converts an integer to a level.

Each of these methods returns a specific type, as indicated in the format you provided.

Note: The `parse` and `toLevel` methods are static, so they are called on the Level class itself, not on an instance of the class.

Also, the `intValue` method returns an integer, so it is the return type for this API method.

The `getName` method returns a String, so it is the return type for this API method.

The `getName`, `intValue`, and `toLevel` methods do not take any parameters, so they are not included in the list.

The `parse` and `toLevel` methods take a String or an Integer as parameters, so they are included in the list.

The `parse` method takes a String as a parameter, and returns a Level object.

The `toLevel` method takes a String or an Integer as a parameter, and returns a Level object.

The `intValue` method does not take any parameters, and returns an integer.

The `getName` method does not take any parameters, and returns a String.

So, the list of APIs from the `java.util.logging.Level` package would be:

1. `public static Level parse(String s)`
2. `public String getName()`
3. `public static Level toLevel(String s)`
4. `public static Level toLevel(int val)`

These methods are useful for working with logging levels in Java.

2. `public void warning(String msg)`: This method sends a log record level WARNING to this logger.

   - Parameters: `msg` - The string message to be logged.

4. `public void config(String msg)`: This method sends a log record level CONFIG to this logger.
   - Return Type: `void`
   - Parameters: `msg` - The string message to be logged.

5. `public void fine(String msg)`: This method sends a log record level FINE to this logger.
   - Return Type: `void`
   - Parameters: `msg` - The string message to be logged.

Note: The `severe()`, `warning()`, `info()`, `config()`, and `fine()` methods are used to log different levels of severity. The level of severity is used by log managers to determine which log records to publish.

Remember, the `Logger` class is part of the `java.util.logging` package, which is a built-in package in Java.

Also, please note that the `Logger` class does not have any methods that are inherited from its parent class `java.lang.Object`.

2. `public void flush()`: This method flushes the stream.

3. `public void publish(LogRecord record)`: This method publishes a LogRecord.

4. `public void send(LogRecord record)`: This method sends a LogRecord to the remote host.

5. `public void setFormatter(Formatter formatter)`: This method sets the formatter for this handler.

Please note that these methods are not inherent from their parent class, but they are part of the `java.util.logging.SocketHandler` package.

Also, it's important to note that the `java.util.logging.SocketHandler` package is deprecated in Java 9 and removed in Java 11. It's recommended to use other logging frameworks like Log4j, SLF4J, or java.util.logging for logging in Java.

@@ Instruction
I want to use java.util.logging.StreamHandler package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.util.logging.StreamHandler` package:

1. `public void publish(LogRecord record)`: This method is used to publish a LogRecord. The LogRecord is sent to the target output stream(s) which may be a file, console, or a remote logging server.

2. `public void flush()`: This method flushes the stream handler. It forces any buffered output to be written out.

3. `public void close()`: This method closes the stream handler. It releases any system resources that the stream handler may be using.

4. `public void setOutputStream(OutputStream out)`: This method sets the output stream to which the stream handler will write log records.

5. `public void setFormatter(Formatter formatter)`: This method sets the formatter to be used by this stream handler. The formatter is used to format the log records as text.

Note: The `publish()` method does not have a return type as it is a void method. The `setOutputStream()`, `setFormatter()`, `flush()`, and `close()` methods do not take any parameters and hence they do not have any parameters in the parentheses.

I want to use java.util.logging.XMLFormatter package from Java

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.util.logging.XMLFormatter` package:

1. `public String getEncoding()`: This method returns the character encoding to be used by this formatter.

2. `public String getStyle()`: This method returns the style to be used by this formatter.

3. `public String getVersion()`: This method returns the version to be used by this formatter.

4. `public String format(LogRecord record)`: This method formats the given log record and returns the formatted string.

5. `public String getDateFormat()`: This method returns the date format to be used by this formatter.

Please note that these are not methods inherent from their parent class, but they are methods of the `java.util.logging.XMLFormatter` class.
