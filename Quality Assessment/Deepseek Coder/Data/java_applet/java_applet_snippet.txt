I want to learn how to use void init() from java.applet.Applet
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);

The `init()` method in Java Applet is a method that is called when the applet is first loaded into the browser. It is used to initialize the applet. Here is a complete code snippet of the `init()` method:

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Graphics;

public class Main extends Applet {
    public void init() {
        // This method is called when the applet is first loaded into the browser.
        // It is used to initialize the applet.
        // For example, you can start a thread here, load resources, etc.
        System.out.println("Applet initialized");
    }

    public void start() {
        // This method is called when the applet is started.
        // You can start animations, etc. here.
        System.out.println("Applet started");
    }

    public void stop() {
        // This method is called when the applet is stopped.
        // You can stop animations, etc. here.
        System.out.println("Applet stopped");
    }

    public void destroy() {
        // This method is called when the applet is unloaded from the browser.
        // You can clean up resources, etc. here.
        System.out.println("Applet destroyed");
    }

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        // This method is called when the applet needs to be repainted.
        // You can draw on the Graphics object here.
        g.drawString("Hello, World", 50, 25);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // The main method is not used in applets.
        // It is used in standalone Java applications.
    }
}
```

This code will print "Applet initialized", "Applet started", "Applet stopped", and "Applet destroyed" to the console when the applet is loaded, started, stopped, and unloaded, respectively. The `paint` method is used to draw a string "Hello, World" on the applet.

Please note that the `Applet` class is deprecated since Java 9 and removed in Java 11. For modern Java applications, you should use JavaFX or Swing instead.

The `start()` method in the `java.applet.Applet` class is used to start the execution of the applet. It is called automatically by the Java Plug-in when the applet is loaded into a browser.

Here is a complete code snippet that demonstrates the use of the `start()` method:

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Graphics;

public class Main extends Applet {
    public void start() {
        Graphics g = getGraphics();
        g.drawString("Hello, World!!!", 50, 25);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // The start() method is called automatically when the applet is loaded
        Main applet = new Main();
        applet.start();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, the `start()` method is called when the applet is loaded. The `getGraphics()` method is used to get the Graphics object that can be used to draw on the applet's surface. The `drawString()` method is then used to draw the string "Hello, World!!!" at the coordinates (50, 25).

Please note that the `Applet` class is deprecated since Java 9 and removed in Java 11. It is recommended to use JavaFX or other modern technologies for creating applets.

The `stop()` method in Java's `java.applet.Applet` class is used to stop the execution of the applet. Here is a complete code snippet that demonstrates its usage:

```java
import java.applet.Applet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Applet applet = new Applet() {
            @Override
            public void init() {
                System.out.println("Applet initialized");
            }

            @Override
            public void start() {
                System.out.println("Applet started");
            }

            @Override
            public void stop() {
                System.out.println("Applet stopped");
            }

            @Override
            public void destroy() {
                System.out.println("Applet destroyed");
            }
        };

        applet.init();
        applet.start();
        applet.stop();
        applet.destroy();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create an anonymous subclass of `Applet` and override its `init()`, `start()`, `stop()`, and `destroy()` methods. When we call `applet.stop()`, the `stop()` method is invoked, and the message "Applet stopped" is printed to the console.

Please note that the `Applet` class and its methods are deprecated since Java 9 and removed in Java 11. For modern Java applications, consider using JavaFX or other alternatives to create applets.

The `destroy()` method in `java.applet.Applet` is used to clean up resources that were previously initialized by the `init()` method. It is called when the applet is about to be removed from the display.

Here is a complete code snippet:

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.awt.Graphics;

public class Main extends Applet {
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("Initializing Applet");
    }

    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting Applet");
    }

    public void paint(Graphics g) {
        g.drawString("Hello, Applet", 50, 25);
    }

    public void stop() {
        System.out.println("Stopping Applet");
    }

    public void destroy() {
        System.out.println("Destroying Applet");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // This is not a part of Applet, it's just to test the destroy method
        Main applet = new Main();
        applet.init();
        applet.start();
        applet.destroy();
    }
}
```

In the `main` method, we create an instance of `Main` class, initialize it, start it, and then destroy it. The `destroy()` method is called automatically when the `main` method ends.

Please note that you need to run this code in an environment that supports Java Applets, such as a web browser that supports Java Applets.

Also, please note that the `Applet` class is deprecated since Java 9 and removed in Java 11. It's recommended to use JavaFX or other modern technologies for creating applets or GUI applications.

The `getAppletContext()` method in the `Applet` class is used to get the `AppletContext` of the applet. The `AppletContext` is a context for the applet, which provides services for the applet.

Here is the code snippet:

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.applet.AppletContext;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Applet applet = new Applet();
        AppletContext context = applet.getAppletContext();
        System.out.println(context);
    }
}
```

Please note that this code will not work as expected because the `Applet` class does not have a default constructor. The `getAppletContext()` method is typically used in the context of an applet, not in a standalone Java program.

If you want to get the `AppletContext` in a standalone Java program, you would typically use the `getAppletContext()` method from an instance of the `Applet` class that you have created.

For example:

```java
import java.applet.Applet;
import java.applet.AppletContext;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyApplet applet = new MyApplet();
        AppletContext context = applet.getAppletContext();
        System.out.println(context);
    }
}

class MyApplet extends Applet {
    // Your applet code here
}
```

In this example, `MyApplet` is a subclass of `Applet`, and we are calling `getAppletContext()` on an instance of `MyApplet`.
