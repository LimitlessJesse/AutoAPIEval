Sample: 0 Applet
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Instruction
I want to use java.applet.Applet package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.applet.Applet` package:

1. `void init()`: This method is called when the applet is first loaded into the browser.

2. `void start()`: This method is called when the applet is started.

3. `void stop()`: This method is called when the applet is stopped.

4. `void destroy()`: This method is called when the applet is about to be unloaded from the browser.

5. `AppletContext getAppletContext()`: This method returns the AppletContext for this applet.

Note: The `init()`, `start()`, `stop()`, and `destroy()` methods are inherent from the `java.applet.Applet` class and are not included in the list.

Remember, the `java.applet.Applet` package is deprecated since Java 9 and removed in Java 11. It's recommended to use JavaFX for creating applets.
