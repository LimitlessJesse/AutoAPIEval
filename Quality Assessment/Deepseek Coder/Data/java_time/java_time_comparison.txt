@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful APIs from the `java.time.LocalDate` package:

1. `int getYear()`: This method returns the year, such as 2000.

2. `Month getMonth()`: This method returns the month, such as JANUARY.

3. `int getDayOfMonth()`: This method returns the day-of-month field, such as 1 to 31.

4. `DayOfWeek getDayOfWeek()`: This method returns the day-of-week field, such as MONDAY.

5. `LocalDate plusDays(long daysToAdd)`: This method adds the specified number of days to this date.

Note: The `minusDays` method is not included because it's not as commonly used as the `plusDays` method.

@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful methods from the `java.time.YearMonth` package:

1. `getYear()`:
   - Return Type: `int`
   - This method returns the year.

2. `getMonth()`:
   - Return Type: `Month`
   - This method returns the month.

3. `getMonthValue()`:
   - Return Type: `int`
   - This method returns the month-of-year field, such as 1 for January.

4. `lengthOfMonth()`:
   - Return Type: `int`
   - This method returns the length of the month in days.

5. `isLeapYear()`:
   - Return Type: `boolean`
   - This method checks if the year is a leap year.

Note: The `java.time.YearMonth` package does not inherent any methods from its parent class.

Please let me know if you need more information or if there's anything else I can assist you with.

@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful APIs from the `java.time.ZonedDateTime` package:

1. `ZonedDateTime toLocalDate()`: This method returns the date part of this date-time in the resolved time-zone.

2. `ZonedDateTime toLocalTime()`: This method returns the time part of this date-time in the resolved time-zone.

3. `ZoneId getZone()`: This method returns the time-zone used in this date-time.

4. `ZonedDateTime withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId zone)`: This method returns a copy of this date-time with the same instant but with a different time-zone.

5. `long toEpochSecond()`: This method returns the date-time as a count of the number of seconds from the epoch of 1970-01-01T00:00Z.

Note: The `toLocalDate()`, `toLocalTime()`, and `getZone()` methods return `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, and `ZoneId` respectively. The `withZoneSameInstant(ZoneId zone)` method returns a `ZonedDateTime`.

Also, the `toEpochSecond()` method returns a `long`.

Please note that these are not all methods inherent from its parent class, but they are some of the most commonly used ones.

Sure, here are five useful methods from the `java.time.ZoneId` package:

1. `static List<String> getAvailableZoneIds()`: This method returns a list of all available `ZoneId`s.

2. `static ZoneId of(String zoneId)`: This method returns a `ZoneId` with the specified ID.

3. `static ZoneId systemDefault()`: This method returns the system's default `ZoneId`.

4. `static ZoneId of(String region)`: This method returns a `ZoneId` that represents the region with the specified name.

5. `String getId()`: This method returns the ID of this `ZoneId`.

Note: The `getAvailableZoneIds()` method returns a `List<String>`, not a `List<ZoneId>`. The `of()` method takes a `String` as argument and returns a `ZoneId`, not a `List<ZoneId>`. The `systemDefault()` method returns a `ZoneId`, not a `List<ZoneId>`. The `of(String region)` method also returns a `ZoneId`, not a `List<ZoneId>`. The `getId()` method returns a `String`, not a `List<String>`.

@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful API methods from the `java.time.ZoneOffset` package:

1. `static ZoneOffset of(String offset)`: This method returns a ZoneOffset based on the given offset ID. The offset ID is in the format ±HH:mm.

2. `static ZoneOffset of(int hours, int minutes)`: This method returns a ZoneOffset based on the given offset in hours and minutes.

3. `static ZoneOffset ofHours(int hours)`: This method returns a ZoneOffset based on the given offset in hours.

4. `static ZoneOffset ofTotalSeconds(long seconds)`: This method returns a ZoneOffset based on the given offset in seconds.

5. `int getTotalSeconds()`: This method returns the total seconds of this offset.

Each of these methods returns a `ZoneOffset` object, which represents an offset from UTC/Greenwich.
