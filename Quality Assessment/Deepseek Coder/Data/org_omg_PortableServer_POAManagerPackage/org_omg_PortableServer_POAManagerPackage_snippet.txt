Sample: 0 State_1
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Instruction
I want to learn how to use int value() from org.omg.PortableServer.POAManagerPackage.State
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

@@ Response
The `value()` method from the `org.omg.PortableServer.POAManagerPackage.State` class is used to get the integer value of the state. The state is an enumeration that represents the state of the POA.

Here is the complete code snippet:

```java
import org.omg.PortableServer.POAManagerPackage.State;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        State state = State.ACTIVE;
        int stateValue = state.value();
        System.out.println("The integer value of the state is: " + stateValue);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first import the `State` class from the `org.omg.PortableServer.POAManagerPackage` package. Then, we create an instance of the `State` class and assign it to the `state` variable. The `value()` method is then called on the `state` object to get its integer value, which is stored in the `stateValue` variable. Finally, we print the value of `stateValue` to the console.

Please note that the `org.omg.PortableServer.POAManagerPackage.State` class is part of the Java API and is not typically used in standard Java programming. It is likely that you are referring to a different class or library that provides a similar functionality.
