I want to use java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are the five APIs from the `java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry` package:

1. `static Registry getRegistry(int port)`: This method returns a reference to the RMI registry on the specified host and port.

2. `static Registry createRegistry(int port)`: This method creates a new RMI registry on the specified port.

3. `Registry lookup(String name)`: This method looks up and returns a reference to an object registered under the specified name.

4. `void bind(String name, Remote stub)`: This method binds the specified name to the specified remote object.

5. `void rebind(String name, Remote stub)`: This method rebinds the specified name to the specified remote object. If the name was already bound, it is unbound first.

I want to use java.util.concurrent.atomic package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are the five APIs from the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package:

1. `public final int get()`: Returns the current value.

2. `public final void set(int newValue)`: Sets to the given value.

3. `public final void lazySet(int newValue)`: Sets the value to the given updated value if the current value is equal to the expected value.

4. `public final int getAndSet(int newValue)`: Atomically sets the value to the given updated value and returns the previous value.

5. `public final boolean compareAndSet(int expectedValue, int newValue)`: Atomically sets the value to the given updated value if the current value is equal to the expected value.

Note: All these methods are atomic operations and are thread-safe.

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are the five APIs from the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package:

1. `void lock()`: Acquires the lock.

2. `void unlock()`: Releases the lock.

3. `boolean tryLock()`: Attempts to acquire the lock without blocking.

4. `boolean tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)`: Attempts to acquire the lock, waiting up to the specified wait time.

5. `Condition newCondition()`: Returns a new condition variable associated with this lock.

Note: The `Condition` object is used to wait and signal on this lock.
