Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is the code snippet for the `getRegistry(int port)` method from `java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry`:

```java
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            // Get the registry on the default port
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.getRegistry();
            System.out.println("Registry found on port: " + registry.getRegistryPort());
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.err.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are using the `getRegistry()` method from `java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry` to get the Registry object associated with the default port (1099). The `getRegistryPort()` method is then used to get the port number of the Registry.

Please note that you need to have a running RMI registry on the default port (1099) for this code to work. If you are running this code on a remote machine, you need to ensure that the RMI registry is running on that machine.

Also, this code is wrapped in a try-catch block to handle any potential exceptions that may occur.

Here is the code snippet for the `createRegistry(int port)` method from `java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry`:

```java
import java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry;
import java.rmi.registry.Registry;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Registry registry = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);
            System.out.println("Registry created on port: " + registry.getPort());
        } catch (RemoteException e) {
            System.out.println("Failed to create Registry: " + e.getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are creating a new Registry on the specified port using `LocateRegistry.createRegistry(int port)`. If the Registry is successfully created, it will print the port number on which the Registry is running. If there is any error while creating the Registry, it will print the error message.

Please replace `1099` with the port number you want to use.

Note: The port number should be between 1024 and 65535. Ports below 1024 are reserved for privileged services.

Also, ensure that your application has the necessary permissions to use the specified port.

This code snippet assumes that you have the necessary permissions to use the specified port and that the port is available. If the port is not available, you will need to use a different port.

Please note that running RMI (Remote Method Invocation) requires a running RMI registry on the specified port. If you are planning to use RMI, you should also start the RMI registry before running this code.

This code snippet is a simple example and does not include error handling for all possible exceptions that could occur. In a production environment, you should add appropriate error handling code to handle all possible exceptions.
