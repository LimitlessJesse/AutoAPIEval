@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.security.sasl.AuthorizeCallback package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are the five APIs from the `javax.security.sasl.AuthorizeCallback` package:

1. `String getAuthorizationID()`: This method returns the authorization ID.

2. `String getAuthorizationMessage()`: This method returns the authorization message.

3. `String getAuthorizationText()`: This method returns the authorization text.

4. `boolean isComplete()`: This method returns a boolean indicating whether the authorization is complete.

5. `void onAuthorization(boolean success)`: This method is called when the authorization is complete. The parameter indicates whether the authorization was successful.

Note: The `AuthorizeCallback` interface does not have any methods that are inherited from its parent class.

@@ Response
Sure, here are the methods from the `javax.security.sasl.RealmCallback` package, along with their return types and parameters:

1. `String getName()`: This method returns the name of the callback.

2. `String[] getPrompts()`: This method returns an array of strings that represent the prompts for the callback.

3. `boolean isInput()`: This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the callback is an input callback.

4. `void setValue(String value)`: This method sets the value of the callback.

5. `String[] getValues()`: This method returns an array of strings that represent the values of the callback.

Please note that the `RealmCallback` class is an interface and does not have any methods inherent from its parent class.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.security.sasl.Sasl` package:

1. `String getMechanismName()`: This method returns the name of the SASL mechanism.

2. `void dispose()`: This method releases any system resources that are used by the SASL implementation.

3. `byte[] evaluateResponse(byte[] challenge)`: This method evaluates the server's challenge and returns the client's response.

4. `boolean isComplete()`: This method checks if the authentication process is complete.

5. `void start(String authorizationId)`: This method starts the SASL authentication process.

Please note that the `Sasl` class itself does not have any methods, but it provides a factory method for creating instances of SASL mechanisms.

Also, the `Sasl` package is part of the Java EE API, which is not included in the standard Java SE API. It is available in Java EE servers and applications, but not in standard Java SE applications.

If you are developing a Java SE application, you may want to consider using a different SASL library that is compatible with Java SE, such as the `javax.mail.Session` class in the JavaMail API.
