Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

Here is the code snippet for the `getClassName()` method from `java.rmi.activation.ActivationDesc`:

```java
import java.rmi.activation.ActivationDesc;
import java.rmi.activation.ActivationException;
import java.rmi.activation.ActivationID;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;
import java.rmi.Remote;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Remote remoteObject = UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject(new MyRemoteObject(), 0);
            ActivationDesc desc = new ActivationDesc(ActivationID.getNextID(), remoteObject.getClass().getClassName(), null);
            System.out.println(desc.getClassName());
        } catch (ActivationException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

class MyRemoteObject implements Remote {
    // Implementation of the remote object
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a remote object `MyRemoteObject` and export it using `UnicastRemoteObject.exportObject()`. Then we create an `ActivationDesc` object with the class name of the remote object. The class name is obtained by calling `getClass().getClassName()` on the remote object. Finally, we print the class name using `getClassName()`.

Please note that you need to replace `MyRemoteObject` with your actual remote object class.

Also, this code snippet assumes that you have the necessary permissions to create and use remote objects.

This code snippet is a simple example and may not work in a real-world scenario. It is meant to illustrate the use of the `getClassName()` method from `java.rmi.activation.ActivationDesc`.

Please make sure to handle exceptions properly in your actual code.

The `hashCode()` method in `java.rmi.activation.ActivationGroupDesc` is a native method that returns the hash code value for this object. The hash code is generated based on the object's memory address.

Here is the code snippet:

```java
import java.rmi.activation.ActivationGroupDesc;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ActivationGroupDesc agd = new ActivationGroupDesc();
        int hashCode = agd.hashCode();
        System.out.println("Hash code: " + hashCode);
    }
}
```

Please note that the `ActivationGroupDesc` class is part of the Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) package and it's not commonly used in standard Java programming. The hash code of an object is used in hash-based collections like `HashMap`, `HashSet`, etc., to quickly locate the object.

Also, the hash code of an object is not guaranteed to be unique across different runs of the program, so it's not recommended to use it as a unique identifier for objects.

If you want to generate a unique identifier for an object, consider using a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) or a database-generated identifier.

The `hashCode()` method in `java.rmi.activation.ActivationGroupID` is a native method and it's not recommended to override it. It's used internally by the JVM to manage the object's memory.

However, if you are curious to know how it works, here is a simple code snippet that demonstrates how it works:

```java

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {

        int hashCode = (int) method.invoke(obj);

        System.out.println(hashCode);
    }
}
```

This code snippet uses reflection to access the `hashCode()` method of `java.rmi.activation.ActivationGroupID` and invoke it. Please note that this is not recommended and may lead to unexpected behavior.

Also, keep in mind that the `hashCode()` method in `java.rmi.activation.ActivationGroupID` is a native method, so it's not documented and its behavior may change in future versions of the JVM.

In general, you should not override the `hashCode()` method in your own classes. The default implementation provided by the JVM is usually sufficient.
