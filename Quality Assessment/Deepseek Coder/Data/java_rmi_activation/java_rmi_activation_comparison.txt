Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.rmi.activation.Activatable` package:

1. `void activate()`: This method is used to activate the object.
2. `void deactivate()`: This method is used to deactivate the object.
3. `boolean isActive()`: This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the object is active.
4. `String getActivationID()`: This method returns the activation ID of the object.
5. `String getActivationSystem()`: This method returns the activation system of the object.

Please note that these are not methods inherent from their parent class, but they are part of the `Activatable` interface.

Also, it's important to note that the `java.rmi.activation` package is deprecated and it's recommended to use Java RMI for remote object activation.

Note: The `getKeys()` method returns an array of Strings, not a List. The `put()` method returns the previous value associated with the key, or null if there was no mapping for the key. The `remove()` method returns the value to which the key had been mapped in the environment, or null if the environment did not contain a mapping for the key.

@@ Response
The `java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem` class is a system-wide configuration class for RMI activation. It provides methods to get and set various system-wide properties related to RMI activation. Here are the APIs from the `java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem` package:

1. `static String getProperty(String key)`: This method returns the value of the system property with the specified key.

2. `static String getProperty(String key, String def)`: This method returns the value of the system property with the specified key, or the default value if the property is not set.

3. `static void setProperty(String key, String value)`: This method sets the value of the system property with the specified key.

4. `static boolean getBooleanProperty(String key)`: This method returns the boolean value of the system property with the specified key.

5. `static boolean getBooleanProperty(String key, boolean def)`: This method returns the boolean value of the system property with the specified key, or the default value if the property is not set.

Note: The `ActivationSystem` class is a utility class and cannot be instantiated. All methods are static, and they operate on system properties related to RMI activation.

Sure, here are the APIs from the `java.rmi.activation.ActivationID` package:

1. `boolean equals(Object obj)`: Compares this object to the specified object.
2. `int hashCode()`: Returns a hash code value for this object.
3. `String toString()`: Returns a string representation of the object.
4. `byte[] getBytes()`: Returns the byte array representation of this ActivationID.
5. `ActivationID getActivationID(byte[] id)`: Returns an ActivationID object from the given byte array.

Please note that the `equals(Object obj)`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods are inherent from the `java.lang.Object` class.

Also, the `getActivationID(byte[] id)` method is not inherent from the `java.rmi.activation.ActivationID` class, it's a static method that creates an ActivationID object from a byte array.

Please note that the `getBytes()` method returns a byte array representation of the ActivationID, which can be used to create another ActivationID object using the `getActivationID(byte[] id)` method.

Please note that the `java.rmi.activation.ActivationID` package is part of the Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) framework and is not commonly used in standard Java programming. It's used in the context of RMI activation, which is a mechanism for starting remote objects.
