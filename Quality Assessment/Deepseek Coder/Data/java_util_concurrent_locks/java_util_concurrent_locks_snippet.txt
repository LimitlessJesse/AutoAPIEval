I want to learn how to use void park() from java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

Here is the code snippet for `void park()` method from `java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Thread is running");
            LockSupport.park();
            System.out.println("Thread is resumed");
        });

        thread.start();

        try {
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Main thread is unparking the thread");
        LockSupport.unpark(thread);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new thread and start it. Then we use `LockSupport.park()` to pause the thread. After 2 seconds, we use `LockSupport.unpark(thread)` to resume the thread. The output will be:

```
Thread is running
Main thread is unparking the thread
Thread is resumed
```

This shows that the thread is paused and resumed after 2 seconds.

In this code snippet, `LockSupport.parkNanos(1000000000)` pauses the current thread for 1 second (1,000,000,000 nanoseconds). The output will be:

```
Before parkNanos
After parkNanos

}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new thread that parks itself using `LockSupport.parkUntil(System.currentTimeMillis() + 5000)`. This will park the thread until the deadline (current time + 5 seconds). After 2 seconds, we unpark the thread using `LockSupport.unpark(thread)`.

Please note that `LockSupport.parkUntil(deadline)` is a non-blocking operation. It will not wait if the deadline is in the past. It will only wait if the deadline is in the future.

Also, `LockSupport.parkUntil(deadline)` is a low-level operation. It is generally not recommended to use it directly in most cases. Instead, you should use higher-level constructs like `java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition` or `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore`.

In this code, we have two threads that try to acquire a lock on the same `ReentrantLock` object. The `tryLock()` method is used to attempt to acquire the lock. If the lock is not available, the method will wait up to the specified time (10 seconds in this case) for the lock to become available. If the lock is not available within the specified time, the method will return `false`.

The lock is released in a `finally` block to ensure that it is always released, even if an exception is thrown.

Please note that the `tryLock()` method is available from Java 1.6 onwards.

In this code, we have two threads that try to acquire the lock. If another thread interrupts one of them, the `lockInterruptibly()` method will throw an `InterruptedException`.

Please note that the `lockInterruptibly()` method is a non-blocking method, it will not block the current thread even if the lock is not available.

Also, the `lock()` method is a blocking method, it will block the current thread until the lock is available.

The `unlock()` method is used to release the lock.

The `try-finally` block is used to ensure that the lock is always released, even if an exception is thrown.

The `InterruptedException` is caught and printed to the console, but it does not stop the program.

The `lockInterruptibly()` method is a part of the `java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock` interface, not `ReentrantLock`. The `ReentrantLock` class implements the `Lock` interface.

The `lockInterruptibly()` method is available since Java 1.5.

The `lockInterruptibly()` method is used in the context of multithreaded programming, where multiple threads can access shared resources. The `lock()` method is used to acquire the lock, and the `unlock()` method is used to release the lock.

The `lockInterruptibly()` method is used in scenarios where you want to ensure that the lock is always released, even if an exception is thrown.

```

In this code snippet, we first create a `ReentrantLock` object. Then we call the `tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit)` method on this lock object. This method tries to acquire the lock if it's not held by another thread. If the lock is not available then it waits up to the specified waiting time. The method returns `true` if the lock was acquired successfully, and `false` otherwise.

We then perform some operations inside the `if` block if the lock was acquired successfully. Finally, we release the lock using the `unlock()` method if it was held by the current thread.

Note: The `InterruptedException` is caught and printed to the console, but it's not handled in this example. In a real-world application, you would want to handle this exception appropriately.

In this code snippet, `lock.lock()` is used to acquire the lock. If the lock is not available, the current thread becomes disabled for thread scheduling until the lock has been acquired.

The critical section is the code that needs to be synchronized. After the critical section, `lock.unlock()` is used to release the lock. This is important to prevent deadlocks.

The `try-finally` block is used to ensure that the lock is always released, even if an exception is thrown.

Please note that the `lock()` method does not return a boolean value. It only throws `IllegalMonitorStateException` if the current thread is not the owner of the lock.

```

In this code snippet, we create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. Then we call the `isWriteLocked()` method on this lock object. This method returns `true` if the current thread holds the write lock, and `false` otherwise. The result is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `isWriteLocked()` method is used to check if the current thread holds the write lock, not if any thread holds the write lock.

Also, the `isWriteLocked()` method is not part of the `java.util.ArrayList` class, it's part of the `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock` class.

        ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
        System.out.println("Initial read lock count: " + lock.getReadLockCount());

        lock.readLock().unlock();
        System.out.println("Read lock count after releasing read lock: " + lock.getReadLockCount());
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. We then print the initial read lock count using `getReadLockCount()`. After that, we acquire the read lock using `lock()` and print the read lock count again. Finally, we release the read lock using `unlock()` and print the read lock count one more time.

The output of this program will be:

```
Initial read lock count: 0
Read lock count after acquiring read lock: 1
Read lock count after releasing read lock: 0
```

This shows that the read lock count increases when the lock is acquired and decreases when the lock is released.

In this code snippet, we first create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. Then we get the `WriteLock` from the `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. We then call the `lock()` method on the `WriteLock` object to acquire the lock. After the lock is acquired, we can perform write operations. Finally, we call the `unlock()` method to release the lock.

The `lock()` method is used to atomically acquire the write lock. It will block until the lock is free. If the current thread:

- Is a regular thread, it will acquire the write lock if it is free.
- Is a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` thread (a thread that is waiting to acquire the lock, or a thread that is blocked from acquiring the lock because of a `ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock`), it will not be blocked.
- Is a `ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock` thread, it will not be blocked.

The `lock()` method is a non-blocking method, it will not block the current thread. If the lock is not free, the current thread will not be blocked, but it will not acquire the lock.

The `lock()` method is a blocking method, it will block the current thread until the lock is free.

They should be used within a `synchronized` block or method, and they will throw `IllegalMonitorStateException` if used outside of a synchronized context.

Also, `await()` will release the lock and wait for the condition to be signaled. When the condition is signaled, the thread will re-acquire the lock. `signalAll()` will wake up all threads that are waiting on the condition.

Here is the complete code snippet with the `tryLock` method from `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
        ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock writeLock = lock.writeLock();
        
        // Try to acquire the lock
        boolean isLocked = writeLock.tryLock();

        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` and get the `WriteLock` from it. We then try to acquire the lock using the `tryLock` method. If the lock is not available, it will return `false`.

Next, we try to acquire the lock with a timeout. If the lock is not available within the specified time, it will return `false`. If the lock is available, it will return `true`.

Please note that the `tryLock` method can throw an `InterruptedException` if the current thread is interrupted while waiting for the lock.

Also, remember that the `tryLock` method does not block the current thread, it only returns immediately. If you want to block the current thread until the lock is acquired, you should use the `lock` method instead.

In this code snippet, we first create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. Then we get the `WriteLock` from the `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. We then call the `lock()` method on the `WriteLock` object to acquire the lock. After the lock is acquired, we can perform write operations. Finally, we call the `unlock()` method to release the lock.

The `lock()` method is used to atomically acquire the write lock. It will block until the lock is free. If the current thread:

- Is a regular thread, it will acquire the write lock if it is free.
- Is a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` thread (a thread that is waiting to acquire the lock, or a thread that is blocked from acquiring the lock because of a `ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock`), it will not be blocked.
- Is a `ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock` thread, it will not be blocked.

The `lock()` method is a non-blocking method, it will not block the current thread. If the lock is not free, the current thread will not be blocked, but it will not acquire the lock.

The `lock()` method is a blocking method, it will block the current thread until the lock is free.

In this code snippet, we first create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. Then we get the `WriteLock` from the `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. After that, we use the `newCondition()` method from the `WriteLock` to generate a new `Condition` object. Finally, we use the `await()` and `signalAll()` methods from the `Condition` object.

Please note that `await()` and `signalAll()` are part of the `java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition` interface and are used for thread synchronization. They should be used within a `synchronized` block or method, and they will throw `IllegalMonitorStateException` if used outside of a synchronized context.

Also, `await()` will release the lock and wait for the condition to be signaled. When the condition is signaled, the thread will re-acquire the lock. `signalAll()` will wake up all threads that are waiting on the condition.

Please note that `ReentrantReadWriteLock` is a complex topic and this code snippet is a very basic usage of it. For a more in-depth understanding, I recommend studying the `ReentrantReadWriteLock` documentation and examples.

Next, we try to acquire the lock with a timeout. If the lock is not available within the specified time, it will return `false`. If the lock is available, it will return `true`.

Please note that the `tryLock` method can throw an `InterruptedException` if the current thread is interrupted while waiting for the lock.

Also, remember that the `tryLock` method does not block the current thread, it only returns immediately. If you want to block the current thread until the lock is acquired, you should use the `lock` method instead.

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();

Here is the complete code snippet with import statement and usage of `newCondition()` method from `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
        WriteLock writeLock = lock.writeLock();

        // Generate a new condition
        java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition condition = writeLock.newCondition();

        // Usage of condition
        try {
            // Waiting for condition
            condition.await();

            // Signal all waiting threads
            condition.signalAll();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. Then we get the `WriteLock` from the `ReentrantReadWriteLock` object. After that, we use the `newCondition()` method from the `WriteLock` to generate a new `Condition` object. Finally, we use the `await()` and `signalAll()` methods from the `Condition` object.

Please note that `await()` and `signalAll()` are part of the `java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition` interface and are used for thread synchronization. They should be used within a `synchronized` block or method, and they will throw `IllegalMonitorStateException` if used outside of a synchronized context.

Also, `await()` will release the lock and wait for the condition to be signaled. When the condition is signaled, the thread will re-acquire the lock. `signalAll()` will wake up all threads that are waiting on the condition.

Please note that `ReentrantReadWriteLock` is a complex topic and this code snippet is a very basic usage of it. For a more in-depth understanding, I recommend studying the `ReentrantReadWriteLock` documentation and examples.

The `long writeLock()` method from `java.util.concurrent.locks.StampedLock` is used to acquire a write lock. This lock is used for write-intensive scenarios where multiple threads can hold the lock at the same time.

Here is a complete code snippet:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.StampedLock;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StampedLock lock = new StampedLock();
        long stamp = lock.writeLock();
        try {
            // Write operations here
        } finally {
            lock.unlockWrite(stamp);
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `StampedLock` object. Then we acquire a write lock using the `writeLock()` method, which returns a stamp. We then perform our write operations inside a try block. Finally, we release the lock using the `unlockWrite(long stamp)` method.

Remember that the `unlockWrite(long stamp)` method should always be called, even if an exception is thrown. This is why it's in a finally block.

Also, note that the `writeLock()` method can block if a read lock is held by another thread, or if a write lock is held by another thread.

This method is part of the Java Concurrency API and is used to handle scenarios where multiple threads need to write to a shared resource, but no thread should be able to read while a write is in progress.

Here is the complete code snippet of the `long tryOptimisticRead()` method from `java.util.concurrent.locks.StampedLock`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.StampedLock;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StampedLock lock = new StampedLock();
        long stamp = lock.tryOptimisticRead();

    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a new `StampedLock` object. Then we call the `tryOptimisticRead()` method on the lock object. This method returns a long value representing the stamp of the optimistic read lock. The stamp is a non-zero value if the read lock could be acquired, and zero if it could not.

Please note that the `tryOptimisticRead()` method does not actually acquire a read lock. It is used to check if a read lock could be acquired without blocking. This is useful in a multi-threaded environment where you want to avoid blocking other threads while you perform a read operation.

Also, the `tryOptimisticRead()` method does not provide any guarantees about the order of execution of other threads. It simply allows you to check if a read lock could be acquired without blocking.

In this code snippet, we first create a `StampedLock` object. Then we acquire a write lock and get its stamp. We then validate the stamp using the `validate(long stamp)` method. The result is printed to the console. Finally, we release the lock.

Please note that the `validate(long stamp)` method is not part of the `java.util.concurrent.locks.StampedLock` API. It is a method I added for demonstration purposes.

Also, the `validate(long stamp)` method is not used in a typical scenario. It is used in a scenario where you have a stamp and you want to check if the lock is still valid. This is useful in a multithreaded environment where you might have a stamp and you want to check if the lock is still valid before you use it.

In a typical scenario, you would not need to validate a stamp. The lock will automatically be validated when you try to lock again. If the lock is not valid, the lock will not be acquired and an exception will be thrown.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.
