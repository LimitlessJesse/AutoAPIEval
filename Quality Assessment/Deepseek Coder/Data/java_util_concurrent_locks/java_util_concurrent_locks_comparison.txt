For example:

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractOwnableSynchronizer` package:

1. `protected void setOwner(Thread thread)`: This method sets the owner of this synchronizer to the current thread.

2. `protected Thread getOwner()`: This method returns the owner of this synchronizer or null if the synchronizer has not been owned by a thread.

3. `protected boolean isHeldByCurrentThread()`: This method returns true if and only if the current thread is the owner of this synchronizer.

4. `protected final void setExclusiveOwnerThread(Thread thread)`: This method sets the owner of this synchronizer to the given thread.

5. `protected final Thread getExclusiveOwnerThread()`: This method returns the owner of this synchronizer or null if the synchronizer has not been owned by a thread.

Note: The methods `setOwner`, `getOwner`, `isHeldByCurrentThread`, `setExclusiveOwnerThread`, and `getExclusiveOwnerThread` are protected, meaning they are accessible only within the same package or by subclasses.

Please note that these methods are not part of the `java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractOwnableSynchronizer` class, but are used in the context of this class.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer` package:

1. `protected int tryAcquireShared(int arg)`: This method is used to try to acquire the lock. It returns the number of threads that can now acquire the lock.

2. `protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int arg)`: This method is used to try to release the lock. It returns true if the lock was released as a result of this call.

3. `protected boolean isHeldExclusively()`: This method checks if the current thread holds the lock exclusively.

4. `protected int getState()`: This method returns the current state of the synchronizer.

5. `protected void setState(int newState)`: This method sets the state of the synchronizer to the given new state.

Note: These methods are protected, meaning they are not accessible from outside the package.

Please note that these are not all the APIs, but the ones that seem most useful for your use case. The actual APIs may vary depending on the specific implementation of `AbstractQueuedLongSynchronizer`.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer` package:

1. `protected int tryAcquireShared(int arg)`: This method is used to try to acquire in shared mode. It returns an int value indicating the result of the attempt.

2. `protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int arg)`: This method is used to try to release in shared mode. It returns a boolean value indicating the result of the attempt.

3. `protected boolean isHeldExclusively()`: This method checks if the current thread holds the lock exclusively. It returns a boolean value.

4. `protected final int getState()`: This method returns the current state of the synchronizer. It returns an int value.

5. `protected final void setState(int newState)`: This method sets the state of the synchronizer. It takes an int parameter representing the new state. It returns void.

Note: These methods are protected, meaning they are not accessible from outside the package.

Please note that these are not all the APIs, but the ones that are most commonly used in conjunction with `AbstractQueuedSynchronizer`.

@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful methods from the `java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport` package:

1. `void park()`: This method causes the current thread to wait until it is awakened, typically by another thread invoking the `unpark` method for this thread.

2. `void parkNanos(long nanos)`: This method causes the current thread to wait until it is awakened, typically by another thread invoking the `unpark` method for this thread, or the specified waiting time has elapsed.

3. `void parkUntil(long deadline)`: This method causes the current thread to wait until it is awakened, typically by another thread invoking the `unpark` method for this thread, or the specified time has passed.

4. `void unpark(Thread thread)`: This method wakes up the specified thread (if it is waiting on `LockSupport`) if it is not awakened.

5. `boolean isParked(Thread thread)`: This method checks if the specified thread is parked.

Note: All these methods are static, so they can be called directly on the `LockSupport` class without creating an instance of the class.
