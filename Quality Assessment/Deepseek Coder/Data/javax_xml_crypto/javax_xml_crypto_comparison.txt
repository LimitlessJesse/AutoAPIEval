Sample: 0 KeySelector
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.xml.crypto.KeySelector package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `javax.xml.crypto.KeySelector` package:

1. `KeySelectorResult selectKey(KeySelector.Purpose purpose, PrivateKey privateKey, X509Certificate[] certificateChain, XMLCryptoContext context)`: This method selects a key for the specified purpose.

2. `List getKeySelectors()`: This method returns a list of KeySelectors that are associated with this KeySelector.

3. `void setKeySelectors(List keySelectors)`: This method sets the list of KeySelectors that are associated with this KeySelector.

4. `List getKeySources()`: This method returns a list of KeySources that are associated with this KeySelector.

5. `void setKeySources(List keySources)`: This method sets the list of KeySources that are associated with this KeySelector.

Note: The `KeySelectorResult`, `Purpose`, `PrivateKey`, `X509Certificate`, and `XMLCryptoContext` are classes in the `javax.xml.crypto` package.

These methods are not inherent from their parent class, they are specific to the `KeySelector` class.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.xml.crypto.KeySelector.Purpose` package:

1. `public static KeySelector.Purpose ENCRYPTION`: This method is used for encryption purposes.

2. `public static KeySelector.Purpose DECRYPTION`: This method is used for decryption purposes.

3. `public static KeySelector.Purpose SIGNING`: This method is used for signing purposes.

4. `public static KeySelector.Purpose VERIFYING`: This method is used for verifying purposes.

5. `public static KeySelector.Purpose WRAPPING`: This method is used for wrapping purposes.

Please note that these are static methods, so you don't need to instantiate a `KeySelector.Purpose` object to use them.

Also, these methods do not inherent from their parent class, as they are static methods of the `KeySelector.Purpose` class.

The return type of these methods is `KeySelector.Purpose`, which is an enum representing the purpose of a key selector. The parameters are not applicable for these methods as they are static methods.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.xml.crypto.OctetStreamData` package:

1. `public int getLength()`: This method returns the length of the octet stream data.

2. `public byte[] getOctets()`: This method returns the octet stream data as a byte array.

3. `public InputStream getInputStream()`: This method returns an InputStream that can be used to read the octet stream data.

4. `public void setOctets(byte[] octets)`: This method sets the octet stream data from a byte array.

5. `public void setInputStream(InputStream is)`: This method sets the octet stream data from an InputStream.

Please note that these are not methods inherent from their parent class, but they are methods of the `OctetStreamData` class.
