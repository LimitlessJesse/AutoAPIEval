I want to learn how to use void setTime(long time) from java.sql.Time
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");

Here is the complete code snippet of the `setTime(long time)` method from `java.sql.Time`:

```java
import java.sql.Time;
import java.sql.Timestamp;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Time time = new Time(0);
        System.out.println("Initial time: " + time.toString());

        time.setTime(123456789);
        System.out.println("Updated time: " + time.toString());
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `Time` object with an initial time of 0 milliseconds. We then call the `setTime(long time)` method on this object, passing in a new time of 123456789 milliseconds. Finally, we print out the initial and updated times.

Please note that the `setTime(long time)` method sets the time value in milliseconds since the standard base time known as "the epoch", namely midnight, January 1, 1970, in the UTC time zone.

Also, the `Time` class is deprecated since Java 8 and it's recommended to use `java.sql.Timestamp` or `java.time.LocalTime` for date and time manipulation.

Here is the code snippet for the `toString()` method from `java.sql.Time`:

```java
import java.sql.Time;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Time time = new Time(12, 30, 0);
        System.out.println(time.toString());
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new `Time` object with the current time. Then we call the `toString()` method on this object, which returns a string representation of the time. This string is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `Time` class is part of the `java.sql` package, not `java.util`. The `java.sql` package contains classes for working with databases, while `java.util` contains general-purpose classes.

Also, the `Time` class is deprecated since Java 8. It's recommended to use `java.time` package for date and time manipulation.

Here is the code snippet for the `long getTime()` method from `java.sql.Timestamp`:

        Timestamp timestamp = new Timestamp(new Date().getTime());
        long time = timestamp.getTime();
        System.out.println(time);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `Timestamp` object by passing the current time in milliseconds to the `Timestamp` constructor. We then call the `getTime()` method on the `Timestamp` object, which returns the time in milliseconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00.000) represented by this `Timestamp` object.

Please note that the `getTime()` method returns the time in milliseconds since the epoch, not in seconds.

Also, the `Timestamp` class is part of the `java.sql` package, which is used for database operations, while the `Date` class is part of the `java.util` package, which is used for general date and time operations.

In this code snippet, we first create a new `Timestamp` object with the current time. Then we use the `setTime(long time)` method to set a new time for the `Timestamp` object. The new time is specified in milliseconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).

Please note that the `setTime(long time)` method does not return a value, so it's a void method. It directly modifies the `Timestamp` object.

Also, please note that the `setTime(long time)` method does not check if the provided time is in the valid range. If you pass an invalid time, the `Timestamp` object will be set to the closest valid time.

In this code snippet, we create two `Timestamp` objects with the current time. Then we call the `compareTo` method on the first timestamp and pass the second one as an argument. The `compareTo` method returns an integer that indicates whether the first timestamp is earlier, later, or equal to the second one. The result is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `compareTo` method is not a part of the `java.sql.Timestamp` class, it's a part of the `java.util.Comparable` interface, which `Timestamp` class implements.

The `hashCode()` method in the `java.sql.Timestamp` class returns a hash code for this date and time. The hash code is computed as:

```java
int hashCode()
```

Here is a complete code snippet that demonstrates the use of the `hashCode()` method from the `java.sql.Timestamp` class:

```java
import java.sql.Timestamp;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Timestamp timestamp = new Timestamp(System.currentTimeMillis());
        int hashCode = timestamp.hashCode();
        System.out.println("Hash code: " + hashCode);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a new `Timestamp` object with the current time. Then we call the `hashCode()` method on this object to get its hash code. Finally, we print the hash code to the console.

Please note that the hash code of a `Timestamp` object is not guaranteed to be consistent across different runs of the program, as the `Timestamp` class does not guarantee any specific order of the fields.
