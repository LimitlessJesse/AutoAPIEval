I want to use java.sql.Date package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the java.sql.Date package:

1. `public int compareTo(Date date)`: Compares two dates.
2. `public boolean after(Date date)`: Tests if this date is after the specified date.
3. `public boolean before(Date date)`: Tests if this date is before the specified date.
4. `public static Date valueOf(int year, int month, int dayOfMonth)`: Returns a new Date object representing the specified year, month, and day.
5. `public long getTime()`: Returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT represented by this date.

Note: The methods `compareTo`, `after`, and `before` return an integer, boolean, and a new Date object respectively. The method `valueOf` returns a new Date object and the method `getTime` returns a long.

Please note that the `java.sql.Date` class is deprecated since Java 8. It's recommended to use `java.time` package for date and time manipulation.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.sql.DriverManager` package:

1. `DriverManager.getConnection(String url)`: This method returns a connection to the database represented by the given URL. The URL should represent a valid JDBC URL.

2. `DriverManager.getConnection(String url, String user, String password)`: This method returns a connection to the database represented by the given URL. The URL should represent a valid JDBC URL. The user and password parameters are used to authenticate the user to the database.

3. `DriverManager.registerDriver(Driver driver)`: This method registers a driver that can be used to create connections to a database.

4. `DriverManager.getDrivers()`: This method returns a Enumeration of JDBC drivers that are loaded into the JVM.

5. `DriverManager.getDriver(String url)`: This method returns the Driver that is used to connect to the given URL.

Note: The `java.sql.DriverManager` package does not have any methods that are inherited from its parent class.

Remember to import the `java.sql.DriverManager` package at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import java.sql.DriverManager;
```

Also, you need to have the appropriate JDBC driver for the database you are connecting to. The JDBC driver is a separate library that provides the necessary classes and methods to connect to the database.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.sql.DriverPropertyInfo` package:

1. `public String getName()`: This method returns the name of the property.

2. `public String getValue()`: This method returns the value of the property.

3. `public void setName(String name)`: This method sets the name of the property.

4. `public void setValue(String value)`: This method sets the value of the property.

5. `public boolean isRequired()`: This method returns whether the property is required.

Each of these methods returns a specific type, and they take no parameters.

Note: The `isRequired()` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the property is required or not.

Remember, the `java.sql.DriverPropertyInfo` class is part of the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API, which is used for connecting to databases.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.sql.SQLPermission` package:

1. `public SQLPermission(String name)`: This constructor creates a new SQLPermission object with the specified name.

2. `public SQLPermission(String name, String actions)`: This constructor creates a new SQLPermission object with the specified name and actions.

3. `public String getActions()`: This method returns a string representation of the actions associated with this SQLPermission object.

4. `public boolean implies(Permission p)`: This method checks if this SQLPermission object implies the specified Permission.

5. `public String getName()`: This method returns the name of this SQLPermission object.

Note: The `java.sql.SQLPermission` class does not have any methods that are inherited from its parent class `java.security.Permission`.

Please note that the `java.sql.SQLPermission` package is part of the Java Security Manager and it's not recommended to use it directly in your code unless you are working with Java's security features.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.sql.Time` package:

1. `int compareTo(Time time)`: Compares two Times for order. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this Time is before, equal to, or after the specified Time.

2. `long getTime()`: Returns the time value represented by this object since the standard base time known as "the epoch", namely midnight, January 1, 1970, in the platform's default time zone.

3. `void setTime(long time)`: Sets the time value for the time zone.

4. `String toString()`: Converts the time value in this Time object to a String in the format HH:mm:ss.

5. `int hashCode()`: Returns a hash code for this Time. The hash code is computed as the number of milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970, in the platform's default time zone.

Note: The `java.sql.Time` class does not have any methods that are inherited from its parent class `java.lang.Object`.

Please note that the `java.sql.Time` class represents a time value that is independent of any particular date, and is used for operations that involve only time.

Also, the `java.sql.Time` class is part of the Java SQL package, which provides classes and interfaces for working with databases in Java.
