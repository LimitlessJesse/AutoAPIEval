@@ Response
Sure, here are the methods from the `javax.management.remote.JMXConnectionNotification` package:

1. `getType(): String`: This method returns the type of the notification.
2. `getSource(): ObjectName`: This method returns the object name of the MBean that sent the notification.
3. `getUserData(): Object`: This method returns the user data associated with the notification.
4. `getSequenceNumber(): long`: This method returns the sequence number of the notification.
5. `getTimeStamp(): long`: This method returns the time stamp of the notification.

Please note that these methods do not inherent from their parent class.

Also, it's important to note that the `JMXConnectionNotification` class is a subclass of `Notification`, so it inherits all the methods from the `Notification` class. The methods listed above are specific to the `JMXConnectionNotification` class.

@@ Response
Sure, here are the methods from the `javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorFactory` package:

1. `public static JMXConnector newJMXConnector(JMXServiceURL serviceURL, Map<String,?> environment)`: This method creates a new JMXConnector that connects to the service at the specified URL.

2. `public static JMXConnector newJMXConnector(JMXServiceURL serviceURL, Map<String,?> environment, List<MBeanServerConnection> mbsList)`: This method creates a new JMXConnector that connects to the service at the specified URL using the provided list of MBeanServerConnections.

3. `public static JMXConnector newJMXConnector(JMXServiceURL serviceURL, Map<String,?> environment, MBeanServerConnection mbs)`: This method creates a new JMXConnector that connects to the service at the specified URL using the provided MBeanServerConnection.

4. `public static JMXConnector newJMXConnector(JMXServiceURL serviceURL, Map<String,?> environment, JMXConnectorServer server)`: This method creates a new JMXConnector that connects to the service at the specified URL using the provided JMXConnectorServer.

5. `public static JMXConnector newJMXConnector(JMXServiceURL serviceURL, Map<String,?> environment, JMXConnectorServer server, List<MBeanServerConnection> mbsList)`: This method creates a new JMXConnector that connects to the service at the specified URL using the provided JMXConnectorServer and list of MBeanServerConnections.

Please note that the methods with the `List<MBeanServerConnection> mbsList` parameter are used when you want to connect to multiple MBeanServer instances.

Also, the `Map<String,?> environment` parameter is used to specify any environment properties for the JMXConnector, such as credentials or SSL settings.

The `JMXServiceURL serviceURL` parameter is the URL of the JMXMP service to connect to.

The `JMXConnectorServer server` parameter is the JMXConnectorServer to use for the connection.

The `MBeanServerConnection mbs` parameter is the MBeanServerConnection to use for the connection.

All these methods return a JMXConnector object which is used to connect to the JMXMP service.
