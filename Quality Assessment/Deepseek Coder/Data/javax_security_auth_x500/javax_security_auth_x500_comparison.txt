I want to use javax.security.auth.x500.X500Principal package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `X500Principal` class:

1. `String getName()`: This method returns the name of the X500 principal.

2. `String getName(String syntax)`: This method returns the name of the X500 principal in the specified syntax.

3. `String getYIBCString()`: This method returns the YIBC (Yet-Another-ID-Based-Certificate) string representation of the X500 principal.

4. `String getX500UniqueIdentifier()`: This method returns the X500 unique identifier of the X500 principal.

5. `String getEncoded()`: This method returns the encoded form of the X500 principal.

Note: The `getName()` method is inherited from the `java.security.Principal` class, so it is not included in the list.

Remember that these methods are part of the `X500Principal` class, so you should call them on an instance of `X500Principal`, not on the class itself.

For example:

```java
X500Principal principal = new X500Principal("cn=John Doe,ou=Users,dc=example,dc=com");
String name = principal.getName();
```

This will return the name of the X500 principal.
