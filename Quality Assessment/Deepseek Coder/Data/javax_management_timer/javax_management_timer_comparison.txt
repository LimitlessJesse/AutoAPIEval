@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.management.timer.Timer package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.management.timer.Timer` package:

1. `long schedule(TimerTask task, Date time)`: This method schedules the specified task for execution after the specified delay.

2. `void cancel()`: This method cancels this timer and all tasks that have been scheduled for execution by it.

3. `void schedule(TimerTask task, long delay)`: This method schedules the specified task for execution after the specified delay.

4. `void schedule(TimerTask task, long delay, long period)`: This method schedules the specified task for repeated execution.

5. `void scheduleAtFixedRate(TimerTask task, long delay, long period)`: This method schedules the specified task for repeated execution at fixed rate.

Note: All these methods are inherited from the `java.util.Timer` class.

Please note that the `javax.management.timer.Timer` package is not part of the standard Java SE API. It is part of the Java Management Extensions (JMX) which is a part of Java EE. If you are not using JMX, you may not need to use this package.

@@ Response
Sure, here are the APIs from the `javax.management.timer.TimerNotification` package:

1. `long getTime()`: This method returns the time at which this notification is scheduled to be delivered.

2. `void setTime(long time)`: This method sets the time at which this notification is scheduled to be delivered.

3. `String getMessage()`: This method returns the message of this notification.

4. `void setMessage(String message)`: This method sets the message of this notification.

5. `ObjectName getObjectName()`: This method returns the object name of the MBean that sent this notification.

Please note that the `getObjectName()` method is not inherited from its parent class.

These APIs provide a way to manage and manipulate timer notifications in Java.
