The `submit(Runnable task)` method from `java.util.concurrent.AbstractExecutorService` is used to submit a task for execution. It returns a `Future<?>` that can be used to track the progress of the task.

Here is a complete code snippet:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.AbstractExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;
import java.util.concurrent.Future;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an executor service
        ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();

        // Create a task
        Runnable task = new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Task executed");
            }
        };

        // Submit the task
        Future<?> future = executorService.submit(task);

        // Close the executor service
        executorService.shutdown();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create an `ExecutorService` using `Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor()`. This creates a new `ExecutorService` that uses a single worker thread operating off an unbounded queue.

Next, we create a `Runnable` task that simply prints "Task executed" to the console.

We then submit this task to the `ExecutorService` using `executorService.submit(task)`. This returns a `Future<?>` that we don't use in this example.

Finally, we shut down the `ExecutorService` using `executorService.shutdown()`. This will stop accepting new tasks and allow any previously submitted tasks to complete.

Please note that `Future<?>` is a placeholder for the type of result returned by the task. If your task returns a result, you would use a `Future<ResultType>`.

Also, remember to handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of the task.

        System.out.println("Addition successful: " + success);
        System.out.println("Queue: " + queue);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create an `ArrayBlockingQueue` of Strings with a capacity of 10. We then use the `add` method to add the string "Hello" to the queue. The `add` method returns a boolean indicating whether the addition was successful, which we print to the console. Finally, we print the contents of the queue to the console.

Please note that the `add` method in `ArrayBlockingQueue` is equivalent to `offer` method. The `add` method will throw an `IllegalStateException` if the queue is full, while the `offer` method will return false.

Also, the `add` method in `ArrayBlockingQueue` is not thread-safe. If you need to use it in a multi-threaded environment, you should use `put` method instead.

```

In this code snippet, we create an `ArrayBlockingQueue` of Strings with a capacity of 10. We then call the `offer` method to add an element to the queue. The `offer` method returns `true` if the element was added successfully and `false` if the queue is full.

Please note that `offer` method does not throw an exception if the queue is full. Instead, it returns `false` to indicate that the offer was not successful.

Also, remember that `offer` method does not block if the queue is full. It will simply return `false` without waiting for space to become available.

This is a good practice when you want to avoid blocking and know the queue is full before trying to add an element.

```

In this code snippet, we first create an `ArrayBlockingQueue` of Strings with a capacity of 10. We then put a "Hello" string into the queue using the `put()` method. After that, we take the element from the queue using the `take()` method. The `take()` method will block if the queue is empty, waiting until an element is available. If the thread executing this method is interrupted while waiting, an `InterruptedException` will be thrown.

Please note that the `take()` method is a blocking method, meaning it will block the current thread until it can retrieve an element from the queue. This can be useful in a multi-threaded environment where you want to ensure that the queue is not empty before trying to retrieve an element.

```

In this code snippet, `CompletableFuture.runAsync()` is used to run a task asynchronously. The task is a lambda expression that prints "Running asynchronously" to the console. The task is run in a separate thread managed by the Java Virtual Machine.

Please note that `CompletableFuture.runAsync()` returns a `CompletableFuture<Void>` which represents a future that will complete when the task completes. However, since the task does not return a result, the `Void` type is used to indicate that the future will not have a result.

Also, the main thread will not wait for the asynchronous task to complete. If you want the main thread to wait for the asynchronous task to complete, you can use the `join()` method on the `CompletableFuture` object:

```java
CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
    // Task to be performed asynchronously
    System.out.println("Running asynchronously");
});

future.join();  // This will make the main thread wait for the asynchronous task to complete

The `thenApply` method is used to apply a function to the result of this `CompletableFuture` and returns a new `CompletableFuture` that is completed with the result of the function application. The `thenAccept` method is used to accept the result of this `CompletableFuture` and perform an action with the result, in this case, printing it to the console.

        // The program will not wait for the future to complete here
        // It will immediately exit, demonstrating that the future is run asynchronously
    }
}
```

In this example, we first create a `CompletableFuture` that simulates a long running task. We then use the `thenRun` method to specify an action that should be performed when the `CompletableFuture` completes. In this case, we print a message to the console. The `thenRun` method returns a new `CompletableFuture<Void>` that is completed when the action is performed.

The program will not wait for the `CompletableFuture` to complete when we call `future.thenRun(...)`. Instead, it will immediately exit, demonstrating that the `CompletableFuture` is run asynchronously.

Please note that the `supplyAsync` method is used to start a new task. The task is run asynchronously and its result is returned in a `CompletableFuture`. The `thenRun` method is used to specify an action that should be performed when the `CompletableFuture` completes. The action is run asynchronously and does not affect the result of the `CompletableFuture`.

Here is the complete code snippet of the `remove(Object key, Object value)` method from `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentHashMap<String, String> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        map.put("key1", "value1");

        System.out.println("Initial map: " + map);

        boolean isRemoved = map.remove("key2", "value2");
        System.out.println("Is 'key2' removed? " + isRemoved);

        System.out.println("Map after removal: " + map);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `ConcurrentHashMap` and add some key-value pairs to it. Then we remove the key-value pair with key "key2" and value "value2" using the `remove(Object key, Object value)` method. The method returns `true` if the pair was removed, and `false` otherwise. Finally, we print the map after the removal.

Please note that the `remove(Object key, Object value)` method only removes the entry if the specified value is mapped to the specified key in the map. If the map does not contain the specified key or the map does not contain a mapping for the specified key, the method returns `false`.

In this code snippet, we first create a `ConcurrentHashMap` and put some key-value pairs into it. Then we define a `BiFunction` that takes a key and its old value, and returns a new value. This function increments the old value by 1. Finally, we call the `compute` method with the key "one" and the remapping function we defined. The `compute` method replaces the value of the key "one" with the result of the remapping function, which is the old value of "one" incremented by 1. The new map is then printed to the console.

In this code snippet, we first create a `ConcurrentHashMap` and put a key-value pair into it. Then we define a `BiFunction` that takes a key and an old value, and returns a new value. This function increments the old value by 1. Finally, we call the `merge` method with a key, a value, and the remapping function. The result is printed to the console.

The `merge` method atomically updates the value for the specified key, using the given remapping function, and returns the previous value for the key, or `null` if there was no mapping for the key.

In this case, the key "one" already exists in the map with a value of 1. The remapping function increments the old value by 1, resulting in a new value of 2. The previous value for the key "one" is 1, so the result is 2.

Please note that the `merge` method is not thread-safe. If you need thread-safety, you should use the `compute` method instead.

        System.out.println("Queue: " + queue);

}
```

In this code snippet, we create a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` of `String` objects. We then call the `offer` method to add an element to the queue. The `offer` method attempts to add the specified element to this queue, and returns `true` if it was successful. If the queue is full, the method returns `false`. The result of the operation is then printed to the console.

Please note that `offer` method is not available in `java.util.Queue` interface, it's available in `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue`.

Also, `offer` method is not available in `java.util.ArrayList`, it's available in `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentLinkedQueue`.

The `offer` method is a part of the Java concurrent package and is designed to be used in a multi-threaded environment. It's a non-blocking operation, meaning it will not wait for the queue to have space if it's full.

The `add` method, on the other hand, is a blocking operation, meaning it will wait until there's space in the queue before adding the element.

In most cases, you would use `add` when you want to ensure that the operation is successful, and you don't care about the order of the elements in the queue. You would use `offer` when you want to add an element to the queue, but you don't care if the operation is successful or not, and you want to avoid blocking.

In this code snippet, we first create a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` of `String` objects. We then add an element to the queue using the `add()` method. The `poll()` method retrieves and removes the head of the queue, or returns `null` if the queue is empty. The retrieved element is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `poll()` method is a non-blocking method, meaning it will not wait if the queue is empty. If you want to block and wait until an element becomes available, you should use the `take()` method instead.

In this code snippet, we first create a `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` of `String` objects. We then add a string "Hello" to the queue using the `add()` method. The `peek()` method is then used to retrieve the first element from the queue without removing it. The retrieved element is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `peek()` method returns `null` if the queue is empty.

Also, it's important to note that `peek()` is a method of `Queue` interface, not `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`. So, you can't use `peek()` directly on `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`. You need to cast it to `Queue` first.

```java
String element = ((Queue<String>)queue).peek();
```

This is because `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` is a `Queue`, but it's not a `Queue` itself. It's a subclass of `AbstractQueue`, which is a `Queue`. But `peek()` is a method of `Queue` interface, not `AbstractQueue` or `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`.

So, the `peek()` method can't be used directly on `ConcurrentLinkedQueue`. You need to cast it to `Queue` first.

Here is the complete code snippet of the `isEmpty()` method from `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListSet`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListSet;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentSkipListSet<String> set = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<>();

        set.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(set.isEmpty()); // prints: false
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create an empty `ConcurrentSkipListSet`. The `isEmpty()` method returns `true` because the set is empty. Then we add an element to the set and call `isEmpty()` again. This time it returns `false` because the set is not empty.

Please note that `isEmpty()` method returns `true` if the set contains no elements.

Also, `ConcurrentSkipListSet` is a thread-safe set, so it's safe to use in a multi-threaded environment.

In this code snippet, we first import the `ArrayList` class from the `java.util` package. Then we create an `ArrayList` of `String` objects. We add the string "Hello" to the list using the `add` method, and then print the list to the console.

The output will be:

```
[Hello]

When all three threads have finished executing, the main thread will print "All threads have finished executing".

The `CountDownLatch` is a simple and useful tool for controlling the execution of threads. It's especially useful in cases where you have a number of threads that need to wait for some other thread to finish before they can start.

Here is a complete code snippet of the `countDown()` method from `java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Thread 1 is running");
            latch.countDown();
        });

        Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Thread 2 is running");
            latch.countDown();
        });

        Thread thread3 = new Thread(() -> {
            System.out.println("Thread 3 is running");
            latch.countDown();

        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a `CountDownLatch` with a count of 3. We then create three threads that run concurrently. Each thread calls the `countDown()` method on the latch after it finishes executing. The `await()` method is called on the latch to block the main thread until the count reaches zero. Once all threads have finished executing, the main thread prints "All threads have finished executing".

        latch.countDown();
        System.out.println("Count after third countDown(): " + latch.getCount());
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `CountDownLatch` with a count of 3. We then print the initial count of the latch. After each call to `countDown()`, we print the count of the latch to show that it decreases by 1 with each call.

The output of this program will be:

```
Initial count: 3
Count after first countDown(): 2
Count after second countDown(): 1
Count after third countDown(): 0
```

This shows that the count of the `CountDownLatch` decreases by 1 with each call to `countDown()`.

Here is the code snippet for `toString()` method of `CountDownLatch`:

```

In the above code, we create a `CountDownLatch` with count 3. Then we call the `toString()` method on the `CountDownLatch` object which returns a string representation of the object.

The output will be something like:

```
java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch@1b6d3586[Count = 3]
```

This string represents the object type, its hashcode and the current count of the `CountDownLatch`.

Please note that the actual hashcode and count in the output will vary based on the system and the time of execution.

Also, the `toString()` method of `CountDownLatch` does not provide any specific information about the count of the latch. It only provides the count of the latch at the time of the call.

The `tryComplete()` method in `java.util.concurrent.CountedCompleter` is used to signal that the task has completed. It decrements the count of the dependent tasks and if the count reaches zero, it completes itself.

Here is a code snippet that demonstrates the use of `tryComplete()`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CountedCompleter;
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

public class MyCountedCompleter extends CountedCompleter<Void> {
    private AtomicInteger counter;

    public MyCountedCompleter(CountedCompleter<?> completer, AtomicInteger counter) {
        super(completer);
        this.counter = counter;
    }

    @Override
    public void compute() {
        // Perform some computation

        // Decrement the counter
        counter.decrementAndGet();

        // If the counter reaches zero, complete this task
        if (counter.get() == 0) {
            tryComplete();
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(2);
        CountedCompleter<Void> completer = new MyCountedCompleter(null, counter);

        // Start the tasks
        completer.decrementCount();
        completer.decrementCount();

        // Wait for the tasks to complete
        completer.join();
    }
}
```

In this code, we have a `MyCountedCompleter` class that extends `CountedCompleter`. The `compute()` method performs some computation and then decrements the counter. If the counter reaches zero, it calls `tryComplete()` to complete itself.

In the `main()` method, we create an `AtomicInteger` counter and a `CountedCompleter`. We start two tasks by calling `decrementCount()` on the completer. Finally, we call `join()` on the completer to wait for the tasks to complete.

Please note that the `CountedCompleter` class is part of the Java Concurrency Utilities (JCU), which is a set of concurrency utilities for Java. The `CountedCompleter` class is used for tasks that can be completed in any order, and it provides a mechanism for tracking the completion of dependent tasks.

        } catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a `CyclicBarrier` with a barrier action that prints a message. We then create three threads that each call `barrier.await()`. The barrier will only release once all three threads have called `barrier.await()`.

The `await()` method will block the calling thread until all parties have invoked await on the barrier. If the current thread:

- Is the last to arrive at the barrier, it is free to pass the barrier and all waiting threads are released.
- Is not the last to arrive at the barrier, it is blocked until all other threads have arrived at the barrier.

The barrier is reusable. Once all threads have crossed the barrier, it can be reused for other threads.

The `await()` method can throw `BrokenBarrierException` if the barrier is broken. This can happen if the thread that is waiting on the barrier is interrupted or if the barrier is reset while the thread is waiting.

The `await()` method can throw `InterruptedException` if the current thread is interrupted while waiting at the barrier.

The `isBroken()` method in `java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier` is used to check if the barrier is broken. A barrier is considered broken if it is broken by a thread invoking `breakBarrier()`.

Here is the code snippet:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(2);

        // Break the barrier
        try {
            barrier.await();
            barrier.await(); // this will throw a BrokenBarrierException
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(barrier.isBroken()); // prints true
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a `CyclicBarrier` with a count of 2. The barrier is not broken at the start, so `barrier.isBroken()` returns `false`. We then try to wait on the barrier twice. Since there are only 2 parties to the barrier, the first `barrier.await()` call will unblock the second thread, and the barrier will be broken. When the second `barrier.await()` call is made, it throws a `BrokenBarrierException`, and `barrier.isBroken()` returns `true`.

Please note that the `isBroken()` method is not part of the official Java API documentation. It is a method added by me for the purpose of this question.

In this code, we create a `CyclicBarrier` with a barrier action that prints "Barrier Reached". We then start three threads, each of which waits on the barrier. When all three threads reach the barrier, the barrier action is executed, printing "Barrier Reached".

The `reset()` method is not used in this example because the `CyclicBarrier` is not reusable. Once all parties have invoked `await()`, the barrier is broken and the parties are released, and the barrier cannot be reused.

If you want to use the `reset()` method, you would need to create a new `CyclicBarrier` with the same number of parties and barrier action.

Note: The `reset()` method is not part of the `java.util.concurrent.CyclicBarrier` class. It is a method in the `java.util.concurrent.BrokenBarrierException` class, which is thrown by the `await()` method when the current thread is not the last to arrive at the barrier.

Please note that the `add(E e)` method in `java.util.concurrent.DelayQueue` does not have a similar method. The `DelayQueue` class is a block queue that uses the `Delayed` interface for elements. The `Delayed` interface extends `Comparable` and has two methods: `getDelay()` and `compareTo()`. The `add(E e)` method in `DelayQueue` adds an element to the queue.

        return 0;

}
```

In this code, we create a `DelayQueue` of `DelayedElement` objects. Each `DelayedElement` has an element and a delay in seconds. We then put these elements into the queue. When we call `take()`, it will return the element that has been in the queue the longest (i.e., the one with the longest delay).

Please note that the `DelayQueue` is a blocking queue, which means that if you try to take an element from an empty queue, the thread will block until an element is available.

Also, the `Delayed` interface is used to specify the delay for each element. The `getDelay()` method returns the remaining delay for this object, in the given time unit. The `compareTo()` method is used to order the elements in the queue.

This code will print "Taken element: Element 1" after approximately 5 seconds, and "Taken element: Element 2" after approximately 10 seconds.

```

In this code snippet, we first create a `DelayQueue` of `DelayedElement` objects. We then add a `DelayedElement` to the queue with a delay of 1000 milliseconds. After that, we call the `poll()` method on the queue, which retrieves and removes the first element that is not delayed. If the queue is empty, the method returns `null`.

The `DelayedElement` class implements the `Delayed` interface, which is used to specify the delay for each element. The `getDelay()` method returns the remaining delay for this object, and the `compareTo()` method is used to order the elements in the queue.

Please note that the `DelayQueue` is a blocking queue, meaning that the `poll()` method will block if the queue is empty until an element becomes available.

In this code snippet, we create a `DelayQueue` of `DelayedElement` objects. We then add a `DelayedElement` to the queue with a delay of 1 second. After that, we use the `peek()` method to retrieve the first element from the queue without removing it. If the queue is not empty, we print the message of the peeked element; otherwise, we print a message indicating that the queue is empty.

Please note that the `DelayQueue` is a blocking queue that is used for scheduling tasks. The `Delayed` interface is used to specify the delay for the tasks. The `DelayQueue` will remove the task from the queue once the delay has been exceeded.

Also, the `remove(Object o)` method will remove the first occurrence of the specified element from this queue, if it is present. If the queue does not contain the element, it remains unchanged.

The method returns `true` if the element was successfully removed from the queue, and `false` otherwise.

The `DelayQueue` does not support the `remove(Object o)` method, so this code will not compile.

                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }).start();
    }
}
```

In this code, we create an `Exchanger<String>` object. Then we start two threads. Each thread calls the `exchange` method of the `Exchanger` object, passing a message to be exchanged. The `exchange` method blocks until another thread calls the `exchange` method with a message, at which point it returns the message it received.

Please note that the `exchange` method can throw an `InterruptedException` if the current thread is interrupted while waiting for a thread to call the `exchange` method.

Also, the `exchange` method can throw an `ExchangeException` if the current thread is interrupted or if some other thread has interrupted it while it is waiting for a thread to call the `exchange` method.

The `Exchanger` class is part of the Java Concurrency Utilities, which provides a high-level abstraction for concurrent programming. It is often used in producer-consumer scenarios where a producer thread produces data and a consumer thread consumes data, and they need to exchange data between each other.

We define a `Callable` task that simulates a long-running task by sleeping for 1 second. We submit this task to the `ExecutorCompletionService` using the `submit` method, which returns a `Future` that represents the pending result of the task.

We then wait for the task completion by calling the `take` method, which blocks until a task is completed. After the task is completed, we retrieve the result using the `get` method of the `Future`. Finally, we shut down the executor service.

The `submit(Runnable task, V result)` method from `java.util.concurrent.ExecutorCompletionService` is used to submit a task for execution and associate a result with it. The task is executed by an Executor and the result is returned by the `Future<V>`.

Here is a code snippet that demonstrates how to use it:

```java

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create an `ExecutorService` with a thread pool of size 1 using `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1)`. We then create an `ExecutorCompletionService` using this executor.

We submit a task to the completion service using `completionService.submit()`. This task is a lambda function that simulates some work by sleeping for 1 second and then returning the string "Hello, World!". We also provide a default result ("Default Result") that will be returned if the task is not completed.

We then wait for the task to complete and get the result using `future.get()`. If the task is completed, this will return the result of the task. If the task is not completed, this will block until the task is completed.

Finally, we shutdown the executor using `executor.shutdown()` to release resources.

In this code snippet, we create a new `ExecutorService` using `Executors.newCachedThreadPool()`. We then submit 5 tasks to the `ExecutorService` using a loop. Each task is a new `Runnable` that prints a message and then sleeps for 2 seconds. After all tasks have been submitted, we call `executorService.shutdown()` to shut down the `ExecutorService`.

Please note that the `newCachedThreadPool()` method creates a thread pool that creates new threads as needed, but will reuse previously constructed threads when they are available. This can lead to a high degree of concurrency.

Also, please note that the `shutdown()` method does not immediately stop all running tasks. It simply prevents new tasks from being submitted. Existing tasks will continue to run until they complete.

Finally, the `shutdown()` method does not force running tasks to stop. It is up to the tasks themselves to stop when they are ready.

This creates a new `ExecutorService` that uses a single worker thread operating off an unbounded queue. We then submit a new task for execution to this executor using the `execute()` method. The task is executed by the single thread in the executor. Finally, we shut down the executor using the `shutdown()` method.

The `Task` class implements the `Runnable` interface and overrides the `run()` method. This method contains the code that will be executed by the worker thread in the executor. In this case, it simply prints a message to the console indicating which thread is executing the task.

Please note that the `shutdown()` method does not immediately stop the executor. It simply tells the executor that no more tasks will be submitted. The executor will continue to process any tasks that have been submitted before the shutdown command was issued.

        executorService.schedule(task, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);

        // Shutdown the executor service
        executorService.shutdown();

In this code snippet, we first create a `ScheduledExecutorService` with a core pool size of 1. Then we define a `Runnable` task that simply prints a message to the console. We schedule this task to run after a 5-second delay using the `schedule` method of the `ScheduledExecutorService`. Finally, we shut down the executor service using the `shutdown` method.

Please note that the `shutdown` method does not immediately stop all tasks. It simply prevents new tasks from being submitted. Existing tasks will continue to run until they complete.

Also, remember to call `shutdownNow` if you want to cancel all tasks immediately.

The `run()` method in `java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread` is a protected method that is used to execute tasks in the thread. It is not meant to be called directly by the user. The tasks are usually added to the thread's task queue and the thread will execute them when it is ready.

Here is an example of how you might use it:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinWorkerThread;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ForkJoinWorkerThread thread = new ForkJoinWorkerThread(null);
        thread.start();

        // Add a task to the thread's task queue
        thread.getPendingTask().add(() -> System.out.println("Hello, World"));

        // Wait for the task to finish
        try {
            thread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we create a new `ForkJoinWorkerThread` and start it. Then we add a task to its task queue using `getPendingTask().add()`. The task is a lambda expression that prints "Hello, World" to the console. Finally, we call `thread.join()` to wait for the task to finish.

Please note that this is a very simplified example and in a real-world scenario, you would not typically use `ForkJoinWorkerThread` directly. Instead, you would use the classes and methods provided by the Java concurrency API to manage and control your threads.

The `get()` method from `java.util.concurrent.FutureTask` is used to retrieve the result of a computation that has been started by a `FutureTask`. If the computation has not yet completed, the method blocks until it completes.

Here is a code snippet that demonstrates the use of the `get()` method:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.FutureTask;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FutureTask<String> futureTask = new FutureTask<>(() -> "Hello, World!");

        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, a `FutureTask` is created that will run a lambda function that returns the string "Hello, World!". This task is then started in a new thread. The `get()` method is then called on the `FutureTask`, which will block until the computation is complete and return the result. The result is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `get()` method can throw an `InterruptedException` or `ExecutionException`, so it's important to handle these exceptions in a real-world application.

        boolean cancelled = futureTask.cancel(true);
        System.out.println("Task cancelled: " + cancelled);

}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `FutureTask` that simulates a long running task. We then start a new thread that runs this task. After that, we call the `cancel` method on the `FutureTask` with `true` as the argument. This tells the `FutureTask` to interrupt the thread if it is running, and then cancel the task. The `cancel` method returns a boolean indicating whether the task was cancelled successfully.

Please note that the `cancel` method does not immediately stop the task. It only prevents the task from starting a new thread if the task has not already started. If the task is already running, the `cancel` method will return `false`.

Also, the `cancel` method does not prevent the task from completing. If the task is already running, the `cancel` method will return `true`, but the task will still complete.

Finally, the `cancel` method does not prevent the task from being run again. If the task is cancelled, it can be run again by calling the `run` method.

Please note that the `offer(E e)` method does not throw an exception if the operation fails. Instead, it returns a boolean value indicating whether the operation was successful.

Here is the complete code snippet of the `take()` method from `java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingDeque`:

public class Main {

        LinkedBlockingDeque<String> deque = new LinkedBlockingDeque<>();

        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `LinkedBlockingDeque` of `String` objects. We then add two elements to the deque. The `take()` method is then called, which removes and returns the first element from the deque. If the deque is empty, the method will block until an element is added.

Note that the `take()` method can throw an `InterruptedException` if the current thread is interrupted while it is waiting for an element to become available. In this case, we catch the exception and print its stack trace.

Please note that the `take()` method is a blocking method, meaning it will block the current thread until it can return a result. If you want to avoid blocking, you should use the `poll()` method instead, which returns `null` if the deque is empty.

I want to learn how to use int getPhase() from java.util.concurrent.Phaser
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Here is the code snippet for the `getPhase()` method from `java.util.concurrent.Phaser`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Phaser;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Phaser phaser = new Phaser(1); // Initialize a phaser with 1 participant

        System.out.println("Phase: " + phaser.getPhase()); // Prints 0

        System.out.println("Phase: " + phaser.getPhase()); // Prints 1
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `Phaser` object with one participant. The `getPhase()` method returns the current phase of the `Phaser`. Since we have not advanced to the next phase yet, it returns 0.

Then we call `arriveAndAwaitAdvance()`, which registers the current thread as a participant and waits until the next phase. After this call, `getPhase()` returns 1, indicating that the next phase has begun.

Please note that the `getPhase()` method does not change the phase of the `Phaser`. It simply returns the current phase.

After that, we call `arriveAndAwaitAdvance()`, which makes the current thread wait until the phase changes. Finally, we print the state of the `Phaser` again to show that it's now terminated.

Please note that the `isTerminated()` method returns `true` if all participants have called `arriveAndDeregister()` or `arriveAndAwaitAdvance()`, and `false` otherwise. In this example, the `Phaser` is terminated after the first participant has arrived and waited for the phase to change.

Also, the `add` method does not offer any guarantees about the position of the inserted element. It simply appends the element to the end of the queue.

If you want to add an element and wait if the queue is full, you should use the `put` method instead.

Note that the `take()` method can throw an `InterruptedException` if the current thread is interrupted by another thread while it is waiting, so we need to handle this exception in our code.

Also, the `PriorityBlockingQueue` uses the natural ordering of its elements (as defined by their `compareTo` method) to order the elements. If you want to use a custom ordering, you can pass a `Comparator` to the constructor of `PriorityBlockingQueue`.

In this code snippet, we first create a `PriorityBlockingQueue` object. We then add three elements to the queue using the `add()` method. The queue is printed to the console before and after the `poll()` operation. The `poll()` method removes and returns the head of the queue, and the updated queue is printed to the console after the operation.

Please note that the `poll()` method returns `null` if the queue is empty.

Also, the `PriorityBlockingQueue` class does not guarantee any specific order of elements when multiple threads are involved. If you need a specific order, consider using a different data structure or synchronization primitives.

In this code snippet, we create a `PriorityBlockingQueue` of `Integer`. We then call the `offer(E e)` method, which attempts to add the specified element to this queue. The method returns `true` if the element was added to the queue, and `false` if the queue is full.

Please note that the `PriorityBlockingQueue` is a bounded queue, so you may need to specify a capacity when you create it. If you don't specify a capacity, the queue will have an unlimited capacity.

Also, the `PriorityBlockingQueue` uses the natural ordering of its elements, so you need to ensure that your elements implement the `Comparable` interface if you want to use the `PriorityBlockingQueue` as a priority queue.

The `offer(E e)` method is a non-blocking operation, meaning it will not wait for space to become available if the queue is full. Instead, it will return `false` immediately.

The `add(E e)` method is a blocking operation, meaning it will wait for space to become available if the queue is full. It will throw an `IllegalStateException` if the task is interrupted.

In most cases, you would use `offer(E e)` if you want to add an element to the queue, but you don't care if the queue is full or not. If you want to wait for space to become available, you would use `put(E e)` or `add(E e)`.

Here is a simple example of using `compute()` from `java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction`. This example is a simple parallel summation of an array of integers.

import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveAction;
import java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Main {
    static class SumTask extends RecursiveAction {
        final int[] array;

            this.array = array;
            this.lo = lo;
            this.hi = hi;
        }

        @Override
        protected void compute() {
            if (hi - lo < 2) {
                return;
            }
            int mid = (lo + hi) >>> 1;
            SumTask left = new SumTask(array, lo, mid);
            SumTask right = new SumTask(array, mid, hi);
            invokeAll(left, right);
            array[mid - 1] += array[mid];
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] array = new int[1000000];
        Arrays.fill(array, 1);
        ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
        pool.invoke(new SumTask(array, 0, array.length));
        System.out.println(array[array.length - 1]);
    }
}
```

In this example, `SumTask` is a `RecursiveAction` that computes the sum of a portion of an array. If the range of the array to be summed is less than 2, it returns immediately. Otherwise, it splits the range in half and recursively computes the sum of each half. After both halves have been computed, it adds the sum of the right half to the last element of the left half.

In the `main` method, we create an array of integers, fill it with ones, and then invoke the `SumTask` with the array and its range. The result is printed to the console.

Please note that the `compute()` method is not a method of `ArrayList` or `LinkedList`, it's a method of `RecursiveAction`. The `compute()` method is used to perform the computation in a `ForkJoinPool`.

The `getRawResult()` method in `java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask` is used to get the result of the task. This method is called after the task has been executed. The result is returned as a `V` which is the result type of the task.

Here is a complete code snippet:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRecursiveTask task = new MyRecursiveTask(10);
        task.fork(); // start the task
        System.out.println(task.getRawResult()); // get the result
    }
}

class MyRecursiveTask extends RecursiveTask<Integer> {
    private final int n;

    MyRecursiveTask(int n) {
        this.n = n;
    }

    @Override
    protected Integer compute() {
        if (n <= 1)
            return n;
        MyRecursiveTask f1 = new MyRecursiveTask(n - 1);
        f1.fork();
        MyRecursiveTask f2 = new MyRecursiveTask(n - 2);
        return f2.compute() + f1.join();
    }
}
```

In this code, we define a `RecursiveTask` that calculates the sum of the first `n` numbers. The `compute()` method is overridden to calculate the sum recursively. The `getRawResult()` method is used to get the result of the task after it has been executed.

Please note that the `getRawResult()` method is not available in all versions of Java. It is available from Java 9 onwards.

The `setRawResult(V value)` method in `java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask` is used to set the result of the task. The result is a value of type `V`.

Here is a complete code snippet that demonstrates the use of `setRawResult(V value)`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.RecursiveTask;

public class MyRecursiveTask extends RecursiveTask<String> {

    protected String compute() {
        // Some computation here
        String result = "Hello, World!";
        setRawResult(result);
        return result;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyRecursiveTask task = new MyRecursiveTask();
        task.fork(); // Start the task
        System.out.println(task.join()); // Wait for the task to complete and get the result
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a subclass of `RecursiveTask<String>`. The `compute()` method is overridden to perform some computation and set the result using `setRawResult(result)`. The result is then retrieved using `join()`.

Please note that `setRawResult(V value)` is a protected method in `RecursiveTask`, so it can't be accessed directly from outside the class. However, it can be used in a subclass as shown in the code snippet.

In this code snippet, we create a `ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor` with a single thread. We then schedule a task to be executed at a fixed rate of every 2 seconds. The task simply prints the current time in nanoseconds.

Please note that the `scheduleAtFixedRate` method will not execute the task immediately after the initial delay. Instead, it will start the task and then execute it at fixed intervals. If the task takes longer than the period, then the next execution will be scheduled immediately after the completion of the current execution.

Please note that the `shutdown()` method does not immediately terminate the executor. It merely initiates the process of termination. The executor will continue to run any tasks that have been scheduled, but no new tasks will be accepted.

Also, the `shutdown()` method does not wait for the executor to terminate. If you need to wait for the executor to terminate, you can use the `awaitTermination()` method.

In this code snippet, we create a `Semaphore` with a permit (or a number of permits) of 1. This means that only one thread can access the critical section at a time. We then start two threads. The first thread acquires a permit and enters the critical section, then sleeps for 2 seconds before releasing the permit and exiting. The second thread also acquires a permit and enters the critical section, then sleeps for 2 seconds before releasing the permit and exiting. Since the semaphore only allows one permit to be acquired at a time, only one of the threads will be able to enter the critical section at a time.

In this code snippet, we create a `Semaphore` with a permit count of 1. Then we acquire 1 permit using `acquire(1)`. After that, we print "Acquired the permit". After the `finally` block, we release the permit using `release()`, and print "Released the permit".

Please note that the `acquire(int permits)` method will block if the current number of permits is less than the given number. If the current number of permits is zero, the method will block until a permit is available.

Also, the `acquire()` method will decrease the number of available permits by the number of permits requested. If the requested number of permits is greater than the number of available permits, the method will block until the requested number of permits are available.

The `release()` method will increase the number of available permits by the number of permits released.

The `release()` method should be called after the critical section is exited, to release the permit. If the permit is not released, it will cause a deadlock.

The `acquire()` and `release()` methods are used for controlling access to a resource, such as a file, a database connection, or a network resource, among other things.

Please note that the `tryAcquire()` method is non-blocking. It will not wait if the permit is not available. It will return immediately with the result.

Also, the `tryAcquire()` method can be used with a timeout. If the timeout is reached before the permit is available, it will return `false`.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(1);

        boolean permitAcquired = false;

        try {
            permitAcquired = semaphore.tryAcquire(1000, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Permit acquired: " + permitAcquired);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we try to acquire a permit with a timeout of 1000 milliseconds. If the permit is not available within this time, the method will return `false`.

After the executor is shutdown, we sleep for 2 seconds to allow the tasks to complete, and then we call `getQueuedThreads()` on the semaphore. This returns a `Collection` of the threads that are waiting to acquire the semaphore, which in this case is the second task.

In this code snippet, we create a new `Semaphore` with a permit count of 1 and a fairness policy of true. The `isFair()` method is then called on the semaphore, which returns true if and only if the semaphore is in fairness-enabling mode.

Please note that the `isFair()` method is a method of `Semaphore` class and not of `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore`. The `isFair()` method returns true if and only if the semaphore is in fairness-enabling mode.

In the case of `Semaphore`, fairness means that the lock will be given to the longest waiting thread. This is useful in cases where you want to ensure that threads are given the lock in the order they requested it.

In the case of `java.util.concurrent.Semaphore`, fairness means that the lock will be given to the first thread that calls `acquire()`. This is useful in cases where you want to ensure that threads are given the lock in the order they arrive.

Please note that `offer(E e)` method is a part of `Queue` interface and not all implementations of `Queue` may support this method.

Also, `SynchronousQueue` is a blocking queue and it will block if you try to add an element to it if there is no consumer available to take it.

This code will not compile if you try to run it because `SynchronousQueue` is not part of the standard Java library. It's a part of the Java Concurrency Utilities and is available in Java 9 and later.

The `take()` method of `java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueue` is a blocking method that retrieves and removes the head of this queue. If the queue is empty, the method will block until an element becomes available.

Here is the code snippet:

In this code snippet, we have a `SynchronousQueue` of `String` objects. We have two threads, a producer and a consumer. The producer thread puts a string into the queue, and the consumer thread takes the string from the queue. Since the queue is synchronous, the producer thread will block until the consumer thread takes the string, and vice versa.

Please note that `put()` and `take()` methods are blocking methods, they will wait until the condition is met.

Also, `take()` method will throw `InterruptedException` if the current thread is interrupted while waiting for the queue to become non-empty.

This is a simple example, in real-world applications, you would need to handle these exceptions properly.

Here is the complete code snippet of the `isEmpty()` method from `java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueue`:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueue;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SynchronousQueue<String> queue = new SynchronousQueue<>();
        System.out.println(queue.isEmpty()); // true

        queue.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(queue.isEmpty()); // false
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create a `SynchronousQueue` object. The `isEmpty()` method is called on the queue, which returns `true` because the queue is empty at this point. We then add an element to the queue and call `isEmpty()` again, which returns `false` because the queue is no longer empty.

Please note that `SynchronousQueue` is a concurrent queue that uses two locks to maintain the queue. It is not a typical queue you would use in everyday programming.

Also, the `add()` method is used to add an element to the queue. It is equivalent to the `put()` method in `SynchronousQueue`.

The `isEmpty()` method is used to check if the queue is empty. It returns `true` if the queue is empty and `false` otherwise.

The `main()` method is the entry point of the program. It creates a `SynchronousQueue` object and calls the `isEmpty()` method on it. The result is printed to the console.

In this code snippet, we create a new `ThreadPoolExecutor` with a single thread. We then create a new `Runnable` that prints a message to the console. This `Runnable` is passed to the `execute` method, which schedules it for execution. Finally, we call `shutdown` to terminate the executor.

Please note that you need to cast the result of `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1)` to `ThreadPoolExecutor` because the method `newFixedThreadPool` returns a `ExecutorService`, not a `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

Also, remember to call `shutdown` to release resources and terminate the executor. If you don't, the program will hang indefinitely because the executor will keep running until all tasks are completed.

In this code snippet, we create a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with a single thread. Then we call the `shutdown()` method on the executor. This will cause the executor to accept no new tasks and will finish all tasks in the queue.

Please note that the `shutdown()` method does not immediately stop the executor. It simply tells the executor that no new tasks will be added. The executor will continue to process tasks in the queue until it is completely finished.

Also, the `shutdown()` method does not force the executor to stop immediately. It waits for the currently executing tasks to finish. If you want to force the executor to stop immediately, you can use the `shutdownNow()` method instead.

Finally, remember that the `shutdown()` method does not prevent the executor from accepting new tasks after it has been shut down. You can check if the executor has been shut down using the `isShutdown()` method.

This will attempt to stop all actively executing tasks and prevent any new tasks from being submitted. The tasks that are already running will continue to run until they complete.

The `Task` class implements the `Runnable` interface and has a `run()` method that sleeps for 5 seconds. If the task is interrupted, it prints "Task is interrupted".

Please note that `shutdownNow()` does not wait for the tasks to complete, it just tries to stop them. If you want to wait for all tasks to complete, you can use `awaitTermination()` method of `ThreadPoolExecutor`.

In this code snippet, we create a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with a core pool size of 2, maximum pool size of 2, and a keep alive time of 10 seconds. We also set the work queue to a `LinkedBlockingQueue` with a maximum capacity of 2. The `AbortPolicy` is used as the `RejectedExecutionHandler`, which means that if the executor is unable to accept a task because the maximum pool size has been reached, the `AbortPolicy` will cause the JVM to abort.

We then submit 5 tasks to the executor. The tasks are long running tasks that sleep for 1 second each. If the executor is unable to accept all of these tasks because the maximum pool size has been reached, the JVM will abort.

Please note that the `AbortPolicy` is not a good practice for production code. It's more suitable for testing or debugging purposes. In a production environment, you might want to use a custom `RejectedExecutionHandler` that either queues the tasks for later execution, or throws an exception.

                System.out.println("End task " + taskId);
            });
        }

        // Shutdown the executor
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with a custom `RejectedExecutionHandler` that prints a message when a task is rejected. We then submit 5 tasks to the executor. The first two tasks will be executed immediately by the thread that submitted them. The next three tasks will be rejected and their rejection messages will be printed.

Please note that the `CallerRunsPolicy` uses the caller's thread to execute the rejected task. This means that the task will be executed in the same thread that called `execute()`, `submit()`, etc. If the executor is shut down while there are unhandled tasks, the `shutdown()` method will return false.

Also, the `shutdown()` method does not immediately stop all tasks. It does not wait for previously submitted tasks to complete execution. It simply disables new tasks from being submitted.

The `shutdownNow()` method attempts to stop all actively executing tasks and halts the processing of waiting tasks. If the executor is not shut down by the time this method is called, some tasks may never terminate.

The `awaitTermination(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` method allows the calling thread to wait until the executor has terminated.

The `isShutdown()` and `isTerminated()` methods can be used to check the state of the executor.

The `submit(Callable<T> task)` method can be used to submit a task that returns a result. The result of the task can be retrieved using the `Future.get()` method.

The `execute(Runnable command)` method can be used to submit a task that does not return a result.

The `ThreadPoolExecutor` class provides many other methods for controlling and querying the executor.

@@ Instruction
I want to learn how to use void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) from java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

@@ Response
Here is a complete code snippet that demonstrates the use of `void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e)` from `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy`.

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a ThreadPoolExecutor with a custom RejectedExecutionHandler
        ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(
                1, 1, 1, TimeUnit.MINUTES,
                new LinkedBlockingQueue<>(),
                new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy() {
                    @Override
                    public void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e) {
                        System.out.println("Task " + r + " was rejected from " + e);
                    }
                });

        // Submit a task to the executor
        executor.execute(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Running task");
            }
        });

        // Submit another task to the executor
        executor.execute(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                System.out.println("Running another task");
            }
        });

        // Shutdown the executor
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

In this code, we create a `ThreadPoolExecutor` with a custom `RejectedExecutionHandler` that prints a message when a task is rejected. We then submit two tasks to the executor. The first task will be executed immediately, but the second task will be rejected because the executor has only one thread and it is busy executing the first task. The `rejectedExecution` method of the custom `RejectedExecutionHandler` will be called in this case.

Please note that the `ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy` discards the rejected task without any notification. If you want to handle rejected tasks differently, you can create a custom `RejectedExecutionHandler`.
