@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful APIs from the `java.util.concurrent.AbstractExecutorService` package:

1. `void execute(Runnable command)`: This method executes the given command at some time in the future. The command is typically executed in a new thread, but if this method is invoked when the executor is shut down, it will reject the command.

2. `Future<?> submit(Runnable task)`: This method is used to submit a task to the executor service. The task is executed asynchronously and its result is returned as a Future.

3. `Future<T> submit(Callable<T> task)`: This method is used to submit a task to the executor service. The task is executed asynchronously and its result is returned as a Future.

4. `void shutdown()`: This method initiates the shutdown of this executor service. It starts the process of termination, and subsequent calls to `execute()` will reject new tasks.

5. `List<Runnable> shutdownNow()`: This method attempts to stop all actively executing tasks, halts the processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks that were awaiting execution.

Note: The `shutdown()` method does not immediately terminate the executor service. It simply initiates the process of termination. The `shutdownNow()` method attempts to stop all actively executing tasks and halts the processing of waiting tasks.

Also, the `execute()` and `submit()` methods are used to submit tasks to the executor service, and they differ in their return types. The `execute()` method does not return a result, while the `submit()` method returns a `Future` object that can be used to get the result of the task.

The `shutdown()` and `shutdownNow()` methods do not return anything, so their return type is `void`. The `shutdownNow()` method returns a list of tasks that were awaiting execution, so its return type is `List<Runnable>`.

The `execute()` and `submit(Runnable task)` methods do not take any parameters, while the `submit(Callable<T> task)` method takes a `Callable` object as a parameter, so its parameter type is `Callable<T>`.

The `execute()` and `submit(Runnable task)` methods do not return anything, while the `submit(Callable<T> task)` method returns a `Future` object, so its return type is `Future<T>`.

The `execute()` and `submit(Runnable task)` methods do not throw any checked exceptions, while the `submit(Callable<T> task)` method can throw `RejectedExecutionException` if the executor is shut down or if the task cannot be executed for some other reason, so its potential exceptions are `RejectedExecutionException`.

The `execute()` and `submit(Runnable task)` methods do not throw any unchecked exceptions, while the `submit(Callable<T> task)` method can throw `NullPointerException` if the specified task is null, so its potential exceptions are `NullPointerException`.

The `execute()` and `submit(Runnable task)` methods do not throw any unchecked exceptions, while the `submit(Callable<T> task)` method can throw `ClassCastException` if the class of the specified task does not implement `Runnable`, so its potential exceptions are `ClassCastException`.

The `execute()` and `submit(Runnable task)` methods do not throw any unchecked exceptions, while the `submit(Callable<T> task)` method can throw `IllegalArgumentException` if the specified task is not executable, so its potential exceptions are `IllegalArgumentException`.

The `execute()` and `submit(Runnable task)` methods do not throw any unchecked exceptions, while the `submit(Callable

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue` package:

1. `boolean add(E e)`: This method attempts to add the specified element to this queue. If the queue is full, it will throw an `IllegalStateException`.

2. `boolean offer(E e)`: This method attempts to add the specified element to this queue. If the queue is full, it will return false without throwing an exception.

3. `E take()`: This method retrieves and removes the head of this queue, waiting if necessary until an element becomes available.

4. `E poll()`: This method retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns null if the queue is empty.

5. `E peek()`: This method retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue, or returns null if the queue is empty.

Each of these methods has a specific return type and parameters. For example, the `add(E e)` method adds an element to the queue and returns a boolean indicating whether the operation was successful.

2. `<U> CompletableFuture<U> thenApply(Function<? super T,? extends U> fn)`: This method applies a function to the result of this `CompletableFuture` and returns a new `CompletableFuture` that is completed with the result of the function.

3. `CompletableFuture<Void> thenRun(Runnable action)`: This method executes the given action in a separate thread after this `CompletableFuture` completes successfully. The returned `CompletableFuture` does not result in a value.

4. `CompletableFuture<T> exceptionally(Function<Throwable,? extends T> fn)`: This method applies a function to the exceptionally completed `CompletableFuture` and returns a new `CompletableFuture` that is completed with the result of the function.

5. `CompletableFuture<Void> whenComplete(BiConsumer<? super T,? super Throwable> action)`: This method executes the given action when this `CompletableFuture` completes. The action is performed when the future is completed normally or exceptionally. The returned `CompletableFuture` does not result in a value.

Note: All these methods are not inherited from their parent class `CompletableFuture`.

Sure, here are five useful methods from the `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap` package:

1. `V putIfAbsent(K key, V value)`: This method atomically puts the mapping into this map if the given key is not already associated with a value.

2. `V replace(K key, V value)`: This method atomically replaces the value for the specified key only if the current value is equal to the expected value.

3. `boolean remove(Object key, Object value)`: This method atomically removes the mapping for the specified key only if the current mapping is equal to the specified value.

4. `V compute(K key, BiFunction<? super K,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction)`: This method atomically computes a new value to be associated with the given key and then associates it.

5. `V merge(K key, V value, BiFunction<? super V,? super V,? extends V> remappingFunction)`: This method atomically updates the value for the specified key with the results of the given function.

Note: All these methods return the previous value associated with the key, or null if there was no mapping.

Please note that these methods are not inherited from their parent class `java.util.HashMap`.

Also, the `putIfAbsent`, `replace`, `remove`, `compute` and `merge` methods are not available in `java.util.HashMap`. They are available in `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`.

The `putIfAbsent`, `replace`, `remove`, `compute` and `merge` methods are atomic operations, meaning they are performed as a single, indivisible operation. This is important for concurrent programming.

The `compute` and `merge` methods are used for more complex operations than simple put or get operations.

The `compute` method takes a `BiFunction` that takes the current key and value and returns a new value. The `merge` method takes a `BiFunction` that takes the current value and the provided value and returns a new value.

The `putIfAbsent`, `replace`, `remove`, `compute` and `merge` methods are not available in `java.util.HashMap`. They are available in `java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap`.

4. `K firstKey()`: This method returns the first (lowest) key currently in this map.

5. `K lastKey()`: This method returns the last (highest) key currently in this map.

Note: All these methods return a view of the portion of the map, not a new map. Changes in the returned map are reflected in the original map.

Also, the `ConcurrentSkipListMap` is a part of the `java.util.concurrent` package, which provides high-level concurrency utilities. It is a concurrent version of `SortedMap`, and it is sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys, or by a Comparator provided at map creation time.

The `ConcurrentNavigableMap` interface extends `ConcurrentMap` and adds operations for navigating the map, such as finding the least and greatest keys, etc.

The `ConcurrentSkipListMap` is a sorted map that maintains its keys in sorted order, and allows for efficient operations like finding the least and greatest keys, finding a key greater than or equal to a given key, etc. It is a concurrent map and supports concurrent operations.

The `ConcurrentSkipListMap` is a good choice when you need a sorted map that is concurrent and fast.

3. `void interrupt()`: This method interrupts the thread.
4. `void stop()`: This method stops the thread.
5. `void join()`: This method waits for this thread to die.

Note: The `start()`, `run()`, `interrupt()`, `stop()`, and `join()` methods are inherent methods of the `Thread` class, not the `ForkJoinWorkerThread` class.

Please note that the `ForkJoinWorkerThread` class is not part of the standard Java API, it's a part of the Java Concurrency API. It's used internally by the ForkJoinPool and it's not recommended to use it directly in your code.

Also, please be aware that the `stop()` method is deprecated in Java 9 and removed in Java 11. It's recommended to use other methods like `interrupt()` or `executor.shutdownNow()` to stop a thread.

The `join()` method is used to wait for a thread to finish its execution. It's a good practice to use it when you need to ensure that a certain thread has finished its work before proceeding with the next step in your program.

The `interrupt()` method is used to interrupt a thread. It's a way to signal that the thread should stop what it's doing and do something else. The thread should periodically check if it has been interrupted and stop its work if it has.

The `start()` method is used to start a new thread of execution. It's the first method that gets called when you create a new thread.

The `run()` method is the code that gets executed when the thread starts. It's the method that gets called by the JVM when the thread is scheduled to run.

Please note that these methods are not part of the `ForkJoinWorkerThread` class, they are part of the `Thread` class.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.util.concurrent.FutureTask` package:

1. `V get()`: This method returns the result of the computation. If the computation has not yet completed, the method will block until it is complete.

2. `boolean cancel(boolean mayInterruptIfRunning)`: This method attempts to cancel execution of this task. This attempt will fail if the task has already completed, has already been cancelled, or could not be cancelled for some other reason.

3. `boolean isCancelled()`: This method returns true if this task was cancelled before it completed normally.

4. `boolean isDone()`: This method returns true if this task completed. Completion may be due to normal termination, an exception, or cancellation.

5. `void run()`: This method is the core method that Java FutureTask executes concurrently. It is the method that will be executed in a separate thread.

Note: The `get()` method can throw `InterruptedException` or `ExecutionException`, so it's a good idea to handle these exceptions in your code.

Also, the `cancel()` method can be used to interrupt a task that is running, but it may not always stop the task immediately. The task may continue to run until it is finished or until it is interrupted.

The `isCancelled()` and `isDone()` methods are used to check the status of the task. `isCancelled()` returns true if the task was cancelled, and `isDone()` returns true if the task completed.

The `run()` method is the one that is executed concurrently. It is the method that will be executed in a separate thread.

2. `synchronized void remove(Object o)`: This method removes the specified object from this set if it is present.

3. `boolean remove(Object o, Object a)`: This method removes the specified object from this set if it is present.

5. `boolean remove(Object o, Object a, Object b, Object c)`: This method removes the specified object from this set if it is present.

Note: The methods are not inherent from their parent class, they are specific to the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy` class.

Please note that the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy` class is not a part of the standard Java API, it's a part of the Java Concurrency API. It's used to control the behavior of a `ThreadPoolExecutor` when it cannot accept a task.

The `AbortPolicy` will cause the `execute` method to throw a `RejectedExecutionException`.

Here is the code snippet:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(1, 1, 1, TimeUnit.MINUTES, new LinkedBlockingQueue<>());
        executor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy());
        executor.execute(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                // Task code here
            }
        });
    }
}
```

In this code, if the `ThreadPoolExecutor` cannot accept a task, it will throw a `RejectedExecutionException`.

Sure, here are the useful methods from the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy` package:

1. `void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e)`: This method is called when a task cannot be executed by a ThreadPoolExecutor because the ThreadPoolExecutor is shutting down, or because the maximum pool size has been reached.

2. `void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e, ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy policy)`: This method is called when a task cannot be executed by a ThreadPoolExecutor because the ThreadPoolExecutor is shutting down, or because the maximum pool size has been reached.

3. `void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e, ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy policy)`: This method is called when a task cannot be executed by a ThreadPoolExecutor because the ThreadPoolExecutor is shutting down, or because the maximum pool size has been reached.

4. `void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e, ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy policy)`: This method is called when a task cannot be executed by a ThreadPoolExecutor because the ThreadPoolExecutor is shutting down, or because the maximum pool size has been reached.

5. `void rejectedExecution(Runnable r, ThreadPoolExecutor e, RejectedExecutionHandler handler)`: This method is called when a task cannot be executed by a ThreadPoolExecutor because the ThreadPoolExecutor is shutting down, or because the maximum pool size has been reached.

Note: The methods `rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor)` and `rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor, ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy)` are inherited from the `RejectedExecutionHandler` interface.

The `CallerRunsPolicy` class is a `RejectedExecutionHandler` implementation that runs the rejected task directly in the caller's thread.

The methods `rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor, ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy)` and `rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor, ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy)` are not part of the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy` package, but are part of the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy` and `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy` packages respectively.

The `rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor, RejectedExecutionHandler)` method is a general method that allows you to specify a custom `RejectedExecutionHandler`.

The `add(E e)` method is not part of the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy` package, it's a method of the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor` class.

The `add(E e)` method is used to add an element to the end of the list. It returns `true` if the element was added successfully, and `false` if the element could not be added (for example, because the list is full).

The `add(int index, E element)` method is also not part of the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy` package, it's a method of the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor` class.

The `add(int index, E element)` method is used to insert the specified element at the specified position in this list. The elements currently at that position and any subsequent elements are shifted to the right. The specified element is inserted at the specified position.

The `addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)` method is also not part of the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy` package, it's a method of the `java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor` class
