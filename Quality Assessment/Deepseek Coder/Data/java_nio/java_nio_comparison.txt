Sure, here are five useful API methods from the java.nio.Buffer package:

1. `int capacity()`: This method returns the number of elements that can be read or written into the buffer.

2. `Buffer flip()`: This method sets the limit of this buffer to the current position and then sets the position to zero.

3. `Buffer clear()`: This method sets the limit to the capacity and the position to zero.

4. `Buffer rewind()`: This method sets the position to zero and the limit remains unchanged.

5. `boolean hasRemaining()`: This method returns a boolean value indicating whether there are any elements remaining in the buffer.

@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful API methods from the `java.nio.ByteOrder` package:

1. `public static ByteOrder nativeOrder()`: This method returns the current native byte order of the Java virtual machine.

2. `public static ByteOrder littleEndian()`: This method returns the little-endian byte order.

3. `public static ByteOrder bigEndian()`: This method returns the big-endian byte order.

4. `public boolean equals(Object other)`: This method compares this object with the specified object for equality.

5. `public int hashCode()`: This method returns a hash code for this ByteOrder.

Note: The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are inherited from the `java.lang.Object` class, so they are not included in the list.

Also, the `nativeOrder()` method returns a `ByteOrder` object, not a primitive type, so it's not included in the list.

The `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods are used to compare the equality of two objects and to generate a hash code for an object respectively. The `nativeOrder()` method is used to get the native byte order of the Java Virtual Machine.

The `littleEndian()` and `bigEndian()` methods are used to get the little-endian and big-endian byte orders respectively. The difference between the two is the order of the bytes in a multi-byte value.

These methods are useful for managing the position and limit of the buffer, and for marking the current position for later resetting.

Note: The `Buffer` class is the parent class of `MappedByteBuffer`, so some of the methods mentioned are also available in `MappedByteBuffer`.

Remember, the `MappedByteBuffer` class is part of the Java NIO (New I/O) package, which provides support for memory-mapped files. It allows you to map files into memory, which can be faster than standard I/O operations.
