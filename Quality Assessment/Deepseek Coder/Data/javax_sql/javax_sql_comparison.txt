Sample: 0 ConnectionEvent
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.sql.ConnectionEvent package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.sql.ConnectionEvent` package:

1. `void setTransactionIsolation(int level)`: This method sets the transaction isolation level of the connection. The level parameter is an integer that represents the transaction isolation level.

2. `int getTransactionIsolation()`: This method returns the transaction isolation level of the connection. The return type is an integer that represents the transaction isolation level.

3. `void setAutoCommit(boolean autoCommit)`: This method sets whether the connection should automatically commit after each SQL statement. The autoCommit parameter is a boolean that indicates whether auto-commit mode is on or off.

4. `boolean getAutoCommit()`: This method returns whether the connection is in auto-commit mode. The return type is a boolean that indicates whether auto-commit mode is on or off.

5. `void commit()`: This method commits the current transaction. The return type is void, indicating that the method does not return a value.

Please note that these are the APIs from the `javax.sql.ConnectionEvent` package, not from its parent class.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.sql.RowSetEvent` package:

1. `void rowChanged(RowSetEvent event)`: This method is called when a row in the RowSet has been changed.

2. `void rowSetChanged(RowSetEvent event)`: This method is called when the RowSet has been changed.

3. `void cursorMoved(RowSetEvent event)`: This method is called when the cursor position in the RowSet has been moved.

4. `void rowDeleted(RowSetEvent event)`: This method is called when a row in the RowSet has been deleted.

5. `void rowInserted(RowSetEvent event)`: This method is called when a row in the RowSet has been inserted.

Note: The `RowSetEvent` class is a subclass of `java.util.EventObject`, so it inherents all methods from its parent class, excluding `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.

Please note that the `javax.sql.RowSetEvent` package is part of the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API, which is used for interacting with databases.
