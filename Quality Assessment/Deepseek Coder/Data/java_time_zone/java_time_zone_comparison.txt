I want to use java.time.zone.ZoneOffsetTransition package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.time.zone.ZoneOffsetTransition` package:

1. `getDateTimeAfter()`: This method returns the date-time after the transition.

```java
java.time.ZonedDateTime getDateTimeAfter()
```

2. `getDateTimeBefore()`: This method returns the date-time before the transition.

```java
java.time.ZonedDateTime getDateTimeBefore()
```

3. `getOffsetAfter()`: This method returns the offset after the transition.

```java
java.time.ZoneOffset getOffsetAfter()
```

4. `getOffsetBefore()`: This method returns the offset before the transition.

```java
java.time.ZoneOffset getOffsetBefore()
```

5. `isGap()`: This method returns true if the transition is a gap in the offset.

```java
boolean isGap()
```

These methods provide information about the transition, such as the date-time before and after the transition, the offset before and after the transition, and whether the transition is a gap in the offset.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.time.zone.ZoneOffsetTransitionRule` package:

1. `boolean isGap()`: This method returns whether the transition is a gap in the offset.

2. `boolean isOverlap()`: This method returns whether the transition overlaps with the previous one.

3. `Instant getInstant()`: This method returns the instant at which the transition occurs.

4. `ZoneOffset getTargetOffset()`: This method returns the offset that applies at the transition.

5. `ZoneId getTransitionZoneId()`: This method returns the zone ID that applies at the transition.

Note: The `java.time.zone.ZoneOffsetTransitionRule` package is not a part of the standard Java library, it's a part of the JDK 8 Time API. It's used to represent a rule for transitioning between two offsets.

Sure, here are five useful APIs from the `java.time.zone.ZoneRules` package:

1. `ZoneOffset getOffset(Instant instant)`: This method returns the offset from UTC for the given instant. The instant is interpreted as being in the time-zone of this `ZoneRules` object.

2. `ZoneOffset getOffset(LocalDateTime dateTime)`: This method returns the offset from UTC for the given date-time. The date-time is interpreted as being in the time-zone of this `ZoneRules` object.

3. `ZoneOffset getOffset(ZonedDateTime zonedDateTime)`: This method returns the offset from UTC for the given zoned date-time. The zoned date-time is interpreted as being in the time-zone of this `ZoneRules` object.

4. `boolean isFixedOffset()`: This method returns true if this zone has a fixed offset from UTC, false otherwise.

5. `String getId()`: This method returns the ID of this zone, which is a string suitable for use in a time zone database. The ID is in the format of "Region/City", for example "Europe/Paris".

Note: The `getOffset` method returns an instance of `ZoneOffset`, which represents the offset from UTC. The `isFixedOffset` method returns a boolean value indicating whether the zone has a fixed offset from UTC. The `getId` method returns a string representing the ID of the zone.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.time.zone.ZoneRulesProvider` package:

1. `Provider getProvider(String name)`: This method returns a Provider for the specified name.

    Return Type: `Provider`
    Parameters: `String name`

2. `Set<String> listProviders()`: This method returns a set of the available provider names.

    Return Type: `Set<String> `
    Parameters: None

3. `void registerProvider(Provider provider)`: This method registers a new Provider with the specified name.

    Return Type: `void`
    Parameters: `Provider provider`

4. `void unregisterProvider(Provider provider)`: This method unregisters a Provider.

    Return Type: `void`
    Parameters: `Provider provider`

5. `ZoneRulesProvider getInstance()`: This method returns the singleton instance of the provider.

    Return Type: `ZoneRulesProvider`
    Parameters: None

Note: The `Provider` class is a part of the Java standard library and is not part of the `java.time.zone.ZoneRulesProvider` package.

Also, please note that the `java.time.zone.ZoneRulesProvider` package is not part of the standard Java library, it's a part of the JDK (Java Development Kit) and is not available in the Java SE (Standard Edition). It's available in the JDK 8 and later versions.
