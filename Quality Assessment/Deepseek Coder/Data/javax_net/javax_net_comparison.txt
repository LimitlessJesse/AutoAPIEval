I want to use javax.net.ServerSocketFactory package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.net.ServerSocketFactory` package:

1. `ServerSocket createServerSocket()`: This method creates a new server socket and binds it to the specified port. The port number is specified by the port parameter.

2. `Socket createSocket(InetAddress host, int port)`: This method creates a new socket and connects it to the server at the specified IP address and port number.

3. `ServerSocketFactory getInstance()`: This method returns a new instance of the default server socket factory.

4. `ServerSocket createServerSocket(int port)`: This method creates a new server socket and binds it to the specified port.

5. `Socket createSocket(String host, int port)`: This method creates a new socket and connects it to the server at the specified host and port number.

Note: The `ServerSocketFactory` class is a factory for creating `ServerSocket` instances. It is used to create a server socket that can be used to accept client connections.

The `ServerSocket` class represents a server socket that waits for client connections. It is used to create a server socket that can be used to accept client connections.

The `Socket` class represents a socket that is connected to a server at a specified IP address and port number. It is used to create a socket that can be used to send and receive data.

The `InetAddress` class represents an IP address. It is used to create an IP address that can be used to connect to a server.

The `SocketException` class represents a socket exception. It is used to handle socket exceptions.

The `UnknownHostException` class represents an unknown host exception. It is used to handle unknown host exceptions.

The `IOException` class represents an I/O exception. It is used to handle I/O exceptions.

The `InetSocketAddress` class represents an IP address and a port number. It is used to create an IP address and a port number that can be used to connect to a server.

The `SocketAddress` class represents a socket address. It is used to create a socket address that can be used to connect to a server.

The `NetworkInterface` class represents a network interface. It is used to get information about a network interface.

The `DatagramSocket` class represents a datagram socket. It is used to create a datagram socket that can be used to send and receive datagrams.

The `DatagramPacket` class represents a datagram packet. It is used to create a datagram packet that can be sent or received.

The `MulticastSocket` class represents a multicast socket. It is used to create a multicast socket that can be used to send and receive multicast packets.

The `NetworkInterface` class represents a network interface. It is used to get information about a network interface.

The `InetAddress` class represents an IP address. It is used to create an IP address that can be used to connect to a server.

The `SocketException` class represents a socket exception. It is used to handle socket exceptions.

The `UnknownHostException` class represents an unknown host exception. It is used to handle unknown host exceptions.

The `IOException` class represents an I/O exception. It is used to handle I/O exceptions.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `javax.net.SocketFactory` package:

1. `Socket createSocket()`: This method creates a new socket. The return type is `Socket`.

2. `Socket createSocket(InetAddress host, int port)`: This method creates a new socket and connects it to the specified port number on the host. The return type is `Socket`.

3. `Socket createSocket(String host, int port)`: This method creates a new socket and connects it to the specified port number on the host. The return type is `Socket`.

4. `Socket createSocket(InetAddress address, int port, InetAddress localAddr, int localPort)`: This method creates a new socket and connects it to the specified port number on the host. The return type is `Socket`.

5. `Socket createSocket(String host, int port, InetAddress localAddr, int localPort)`: This method creates a new socket and connects it to the specified port number on the host. The return type is `Socket`.

These methods are used to create sockets for network communication.
