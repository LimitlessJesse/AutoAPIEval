Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.management.monitor.Monitor` package:

1. `void addNotificationListener(NotificationListener l)`: This method adds a listener to the set of listeners for this monitor.

2. `void removeNotificationListener(NotificationListener l)`: This method removes a listener from the set of listeners for this monitor.

3. `Collection<NotificationListener> getNotificationListeners()`: This method returns a collection of all the notification listeners registered on this monitor.

4. `void clearNotificationListeners()`: This method removes all of the listeners from this monitor.

5. `void sendNotification(Notification n)`: This method sends a notification to all the registered listeners.

Note: The `addNotificationListener`, `removeNotificationListener`, `getNotificationListeners`, `clearNotificationListeners`, and `sendNotification` methods are inherited from the `NotificationBroadcasterSupport` class, which is a parent class of `Monitor`.

Please note that the `Monitor` class is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly. It is used as a base class for concrete monitor classes that provide monitoring capabilities.

Also, the `Notification` class is used to send notifications to registered listeners. It is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly. It is used as a base class for concrete notification classes that provide specific types of notifications.

The `NotificationListener` interface is used to receive notifications from a monitor. It has a single method, `handleNotification(Notification n)`, which is called when a notification is sent to the listener.

The `NotificationBroadcasterSupport` class provides the basic functionality for classes that broadcast notifications. It includes methods for adding, removing, and getting listeners, as well as clearing all listeners.

The `ObjectName` class is used to represent the name of a managed object. It is used to identify and locate managed objects in a JMX environment.

The `MBeanServer` interface is used to manage the registration and life cycle of MBeans. It provides methods for creating, querying, and unregistering MBeans, as well as for notifying listeners of changes to MBeans.

The `MBeanNotificationInfo` class is used to represent the notification information for an MBean. It includes the type of notification, the name of the MBean, and the name of the notification.

The `Notification` class is used to represent a notification. It includes the source of the notification, the type of the notification, the sequence number of the notification, and the message of the notification.

The `NotificationFilter` interface is used to filter notifications. It has a single method, `isNotificationEnabled(Notification n)`, which returns true if the notification should be enabled, and false otherwise.

The `NotificationEmitter` interface is used to emit notifications. It includes methods for adding, removing, and getting listeners, as well as for notifying listeners of changes to the emitter.

The `NotificationSequence` class is used to represent a sequence of notifications. It includes methods for adding, removing, and getting notifications, as well as for clearing all notifications.

The `MBeanNotificationSupport` class provides the basic functionality for classes that support notifications. It includes methods for adding, removing, and getting listeners, as well as for notifying listeners of changes to the emitter.

The `MBeanServerDelegate` class is used to delegate calls to an underlying MBeanServer. It includes methods for creating, querying, and unregistering MBeans, as well as for notifying listeners of changes to MBeans.

The `ObjectInstance` class is used to represent an instance of an object. It includes the name of the object and the object itself.

The `QueryExp` interface is used to represent a query expression. It includes methods for creating a query expression, and for evaluating the query expression against a set of MBeans.

The `QueryEval` interface is used to evaluate a query expression against a set of MBeans. It includes a single method, `evaluate(ObjectName

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.management.monitor.MonitorNotification` package:

1. `long getSequenceNumber()`: This method returns the sequence number of the notification.

2. `long getTimeStamp()`: This method returns the time at which the associated MBean changed its state.

3. `String getType()`: This method returns the type of the notification.

4. `Object getSource()`: This method returns the MBean that sent the notification.

5. `String toString()`: This method returns a string representation of the notification.

Please note that these are not methods inherent from its parent class, but they are methods of the `MonitorNotification` class itself.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.management.monitor.StringMonitor` package:

1. `void setString(String value)`: This method sets the value of the StringMonitor. The parameter `value` is the new value to be set.

2. `String getString()`: This method returns the current value of the StringMonitor. It does not take any parameters and returns a String.

3. `void addNotificationListener(NotificationListener listener, NotificationFilter filter, Object handback)`: This method adds a listener to the StringMonitor. The parameters `listener`, `filter`, and `handback` specify the listener, the filter for the listener, and the handback object for the listener, respectively.

4. `void removeNotificationListener(NotificationListener listener)`: This method removes a listener from the StringMonitor. The parameter `listener` specifies the listener to be removed.

5. `void removeAllNotificationListeners()`: This method removes all listeners from the StringMonitor. It does not take any parameters and does not return a value.

Please note that the `StringMonitor` class extends the `Monitor` class, which in turn extends the `MBean` class. Therefore, it inherits all the methods from its parent classes. The methods mentioned above are specific to the `StringMonitor` class.
