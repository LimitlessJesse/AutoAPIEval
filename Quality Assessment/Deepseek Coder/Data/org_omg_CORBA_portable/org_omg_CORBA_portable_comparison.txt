I want to use org.omg.CORBA.portable.Delegate package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `org.omg.CORBA.portable.Delegate` package:

1. `boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.
2. `void add(int index, E element)`: This method inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list.
3. `boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)`: This method appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of this list.
4. `void clear()`: This method removes all of the elements from this list.
5. `boolean contains(Object o)`: This method returns true if this list contains the specified element.

Please note that these are just a few examples. The `Delegate` package in Java provides a wide range of APIs for manipulating collections.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `org.omg.CORBA.portable.InputStream` package:

1. `int read()`: This method reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an integer in the range 0 to 255.

2. `int read(byte[] b)`: This method reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the byte array `b`.

3. `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method reads up to `len` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes.

4. `long skip(long n)`: This method skips over and discards `n` bytes of data from this input stream.

5. `int available()`: This method returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next caller of the `read()` method.

Note: The `read()` method returns -1 if the end of the stream is reached.

Please note that these are not all methods of the `InputStream` class, but the most commonly used ones.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl` package:

1. `boolean equals(Object obj)`: This method compares this object to the specified object.
2. `int hashCode()`: This method returns the hash code value for this object.
3. `String toString()`: This method returns a string representation of the object.
4. `void notify()`: This method wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.
5. `void notifyAll()`: This method wakes up all threads that are waiting on this object's monitor.

Please note that these are not all methods inherent from their parent class, but they are commonly used in the context of the `org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl` package.

Also, please note that the `org.omg.CORBA.portable.ObjectImpl` package is part of the CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) specification, which is a complex and low-level framework for distributed object-oriented systems. It's not commonly used in Java applications, and its use may require a deep understanding of the CORBA specification.

9. `void write_string(String s)`: This method writes a String value to the output stream.
10. `void write_longlong(long l)`: This method writes a long long value to the output stream.
11. `void write_ulonglong(long l)`: This method writes an unsigned long long value to the output stream.
12. `void write_longdouble(double d)`: This method writes a long double value to the output stream.
13. `void write_wchar(char c)`: This method writes a wide char value to the output stream.
14. `void write_wstring(String s)`: This method writes a wide String value to the output stream.
15. `void write_val(org.omg.CORBA.portable.InputStream.Streamable s)`: This method writes a value object to the output stream.
16. `void write_array(org.omg.CORBA.portable.InputStream.Streamable s, int length)`: This method writes an array of values to the output stream.
17. `void write_fixedarray(org.omg.CORBA.portable.InputStream.Streamable s, int length)`: This method writes a fixed-length array of values to the output stream.

20. `void write_TypeCode(org.omg.CORBA.TypeCode t)`: This method writes a TypeCode value to the output stream.

Please note that these are just a few examples. The `org.omg.CORBA.portable.OutputStream` package provides many more methods for writing different types of data to the output stream.
