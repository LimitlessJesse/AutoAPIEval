@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.util.zip.Adler32` package:

1. `long update(byte[] buffer)`: This method updates the current checksum with the bytes from the specified buffer.

2. `long update(byte[] buffer, int offset, int length)`: This method updates the current checksum with the bytes from the specified buffer, starting at the specified offset and continuing for the specified length.

3. `long update(int b)`: This method updates the current checksum with the specified byte.

4. `long getValue()`: This method returns the current checksum value.

5. `void reset()`: This method resets the checksum to its initial value.

Each of these methods returns a long value, and they all take parameters as specified in their names.

Note: The `update` method returns the updated checksum, allowing for chaining of updates. The `getValue` method returns the current checksum value, and the `reset` method resets the checksum to its initial value.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.util.zip.CheckedInputStream` package:

1. `int read()`: This method reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned.

2. `int read(byte[] b)`: This method reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the byte array `b`. The number of bytes read is returned as an integer.

3. `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method reads up to `len` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. The number of bytes read is returned as an integer.

4. `void close()`: This method closes the input stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream.

5. `boolean markSupported()`: This method returns a boolean indicating whether this stream supports the mark and reset methods.

Note: The `CheckedInputStream` is a subclass of `InputStream`, so it inherits all methods from `InputStream` except for those inherent from its parent class.

Please note that the `java.util.zip.CheckedInputStream` package is not part of the standard Java API, it's a part of Java's ZIP file system. If you're looking for a way to handle checked exceptions with input streams, you might want to look into `java.io.FilterInputStream` and its subclasses.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.util.zip.CheckedOutputStream` package:

1. `void write(int b) throws IOException`: This method writes the specified byte to this output stream.
2. `void write(byte[] b) throws IOException`: This method writes `len` bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset `off` to this output stream.
3. `void write(byte[] b, int off, int len) throws IOException`: This method writes `len` bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset `off` to this output stream.
4. `void flush() throws IOException`: This method flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output bytes to be written out.
5. `void close() throws IOException`: This method closes this output stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream.

Note: The `IOException` is a checked exception and must be handled in your code.

Remember, the `CheckedOutputStream` is a subclass of `OutputStream`, so it inherits all methods from `OutputStream` except those that are overridden in `CheckedOutputStream`.

Also, the `CheckedOutputStream` is used to wrap another output stream, adding a checksum to the data written through the `CheckedOutputStream`. The checksum is not calculated on the data written to the underlying output stream.

The `CheckedOutputStream` does not have any additional methods beyond those inherited from `OutputStream`.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.util.zip.ZipInputStream` package:

1. `int read()`: This method reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If the end of the stream is reached, -1 is returned.

2. `int read(byte[] b)`: This method reads up to b.length bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. The number of bytes read is returned as an integer. If the end of the stream is reached, -1 is returned.

3. `void close()`: This method closes the input stream and releases any system resources that it may be holding.

4. `String getEntryName()`: This method returns the name of the current entry in the ZIP file.

5. `boolean getNextEntry()`: This method advances to the next entry in the ZIP file. If there are no more entries, it returns false.

6. `int available()`: This method returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next caller of the read method.

7. `void closeEntry()`: This method closes the current ZIP entry and position the stream to the next entry.

8. `long getCompressedSize()`: This method returns the compressed size of the current entry.

9. `long getSize()`: This method returns the uncompressed size of the current entry.

10. `int getMethod()`: This method returns the compression method used for the current entry.

11. `long getCRC()`: This method returns the CRC-32 checksum of the current entry.

12. `int getComment()`: This method returns the comment of the current entry.

13. `boolean isFinished()`: This method checks if the ZIP file has been fully read.

14. `boolean isSplit()`: This method checks if the ZIP file has been split across multiple input streams.

15. `int getTotalEntries()`: This method returns the total number of entries in the ZIP file.

16. `int getCurrentEntryIndex()`: This method returns the index of the current entry in the ZIP file.

17. `int getEntryCount()`: This method returns the number of entries in the ZIP file.

18. `int getRemainingEntryCount()`: This method returns the number of remaining entries in the ZIP file.

19. `int getEntryNameIndex()`: This method returns the index of the current entry name in the ZIP file.

20. `int getMethodNameIndex()`: This method returns the index of the current method name in the ZIP file.

21. `int getCommentNameIndex()`: This method returns the index of the current comment name in the ZIP file.

22. `int getExtraFieldCount()`: This method returns the number of extra fields in the ZIP file.

23. `int getExtraFieldNameIndex()`: This method returns the index of the current extra field name in the ZIP file.

24. `int getExtraFieldValueIndex()`: This method returns the index of the current extra field value in the ZIP file.

25. `int getExtraFieldCount()`: This method returns the number of extra fields in the ZIP file.

26. `int getExtraFieldNameIndex()`: This method returns the index of the current extra field name in the ZIP file.

27. `int getExtraFieldValueIndex()`: This method returns the index of the current extra field value in the ZIP file.

28. `int getExtraFieldCount()`: This method returns the number of extra fields in the

I want to use java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful APIs from the `java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream` package:

1. `void putNextEntry(ZipEntry e)`: This method sets the information about the next entry to be written to the ZIP file.

2. `void write(byte[] b)`: This method writes the specified byte array to the ZIP file.

3. `void write(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method writes a portion of the specified byte array to the ZIP file.

4. `void closeEntry()`: This method closes the current ZIP entry and positions the stream to write the local header of the next entry.

5. `void close()`: This method closes this output stream and releases any system resources that it may have open.

Note: The `ZipOutputStream` extends `OutputStream`, so it inherits all methods from its parent class `OutputStream`.

Please note that the `ZipOutputStream` does not have any methods that are inherent from its parent class `OutputStream`.

Also, remember to always close your `ZipOutputStream` when you're done with it to free up system resources.
