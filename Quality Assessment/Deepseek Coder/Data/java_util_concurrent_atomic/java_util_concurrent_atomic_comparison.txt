Sure, here are five useful APIs from the `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicBoolean` package:

1. `boolean get()`: This method atomically gets the current value.

2. `void set(boolean newValue)`: This method atomically sets the value to the given updated value.

3. `boolean getAndSet(boolean newValue)`: This method atomically sets the value to the given updated value and returns the previous value.

4. `void lazySet(boolean newValue)`: This method atomically sets the value to the given updated value unless it was already set.

5. `boolean compareAndSet(boolean expectedValue, boolean newValue)`: This method atomically sets the value to the given updated value if the current value == the expected value.

All these methods are atomic, meaning they are performed in a single step and cannot be interrupted.

Note: The `AtomicBoolean` class is a subclass of `java.lang.Object`, so it inherits all its methods. The methods inherent from its parent class are not included in the list.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicMarkableReference` package:

3. `void set(V newReference, boolean newMark)`: This method atomically sets the reference and mark to the given updated values.
4. `boolean compareAndSet(V expectedReference, V newReference, boolean expectedMark, boolean newMark)`: This method atomically sets the reference and mark to the given updated values if the current reference is equal to the expected reference and the current mark is equal to the expected mark.
5. `void reset()`: This method atomically sets the reference and mark to null and false.

Note: The methods `getReference()`, `getMark()`, `set(V, boolean)`, `compareAndSet(V, V, boolean, boolean)`, and `reset()` are not inherited from their parent class.

Please note that the `AtomicMarkableReference` class is a part of the Java Concurrency Utilities package, which provides atomic operations on reference types that can be marked. It's not a part of the standard Java Collections Framework.

Also, the `compareAndSet(V, V, boolean, boolean)` method is a bit more complex than the other methods. It takes four parameters: the expected reference, the new reference, the expected mark, and the new mark. It atomically sets the reference and mark to the given updated values if the current reference is equal to the expected reference and the current mark is equal to the expected mark.

The `reset()` method is used to atomically set the reference and mark to null and false.

The `getReference()` and `getMark()` methods are used to get the current reference and mark, respectively.

The `set(V, boolean)` method is used to atomically set the reference and mark to the given updated values.

The `AtomicMarkableReference` class is useful in situations where you need to mark the reference. For example, in garbage collection, you might want to mark a reference as "in use" so that it doesn't get collected.

Note: The `AtomicStampedReference` class is a concurrent atomic reference that holds a pair of a reference and an integer stamp. The reference can be updated atomically while the stamp can be updated atomically or non-atomically.

The `compareAndSet` and `weakCompareAndSet` methods are used to compare the current reference and stamp with the expected reference and stamp, and if they match, to update the reference and stamp to new values. The `set` method is used to update the reference and stamp to new values.

The `getReference` and `getStamp` methods are used to get the current reference and stamp, respectively.

The `weakCompareAndSet` method is a weak version of `compareAndSet`, which means it may return false spuriously, but it will not wait indefinitely.

The `AtomicStampedReference` class is useful in situations where you need to atomically update a reference and a stamp, and you need to be able to compare the current reference and stamp with expected values.

@@ Instruction
I want to use java.util.concurrent.atomic.LongAdder package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Here are five useful APIs from the `java.util.concurrent.atomic.LongAdder` package:

1. `void increment()`: This method increments the current value by one.
2. `void add(long x)`: This method adds the given value to the current value.
3. `long sum()`: This method returns the current sum.
4. `void reset()`: This method resets the value to zero.
5. `long longValue()`: This method returns the current value as a long.

Each of these methods has no parameters and returns a specific type:

- `void increment()`: This method returns void.
- `void add(long x)`: This method also returns void.
- `long sum()`: This method returns a long.
- `void reset()`: This method also returns void.
- `long longValue()`: This method returns a long.

These APIs provide atomic operations on a long value, which means they are thread-safe and can be used in a multi-threaded environment.
