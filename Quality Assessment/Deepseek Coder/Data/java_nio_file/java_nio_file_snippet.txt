I want to learn how to use List<String> readAllLines(Path path) from java.nio.file.Files
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");

Here is the complete code snippet using `List<String> readAllLines(Path path)` from java.nio.file.Files:

```java
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(Paths.get("path_to_your_file"));
            for (String line : lines) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, replace `"path_to_your_file"` with the actual path to the file you want to read. The `Files.readAllLines(Path path)` method reads all lines from a file and returns them as a List of Strings. The `for-each` loop then iterates over each line and prints it to the console. If an IOException occurs (for example, if the file does not exist), it is caught and its stack trace is printed to the console.

Please note that you need to have the file at the specified path to read it. If the file does not exist, the program will throw an IOException.

Here is the code snippet for the `getTotalSpace()` method from `java.nio.file.FileStore`:

```java
import java.nio.file.FileStore;

import java.io.IOException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first get the default file system's root path using `FileSystems.getDefault().getPath("/")`. Then we get the `FileStore` for this path using `Files.getFileStore()`. Finally, we call `getTotalSpace()` on the `FileStore` to get the total space available on the file system in bytes.

Please note that the `getTotalSpace()` method can throw an `IOException`, so we wrap it in a try-catch block to handle any potential errors.

Also, the `getTotalSpace()` method returns the total space in bytes. If the space is not available, it returns `Long.MAX_VALUE`.

```

This code snippet gets the file store of the root directory ("/"), then gets the usable space of the file store and prints it out. The `getUsableSpace()` method returns the number of bytes that can be used for storage.

Please note that you need to handle the `Exception` in the `main` method because `Files.getFileStore(Paths.get("/"))` and `store.getUsableSpace()` can throw `IOException`.

Also, the path "/" is used as an example. You can replace it with any other path you want to get the usable space of.

Please note that the actual output and the usability of the space can vary depending on the operating system and the file system.

This code snippet gets the default file system, gets the file store of the root directory, and then gets the unallocated space in bytes. The result is printed to the console.

Please note that the `getUnallocatedSpace()` method is not available in all file systems, and it may return `-1` if the file system does not support this operation.

Also, the `getUnallocatedSpace()` method is a relatively expensive operation, as it may involve reading the file system's metadata. Therefore, it should be used sparingly and only when necessary.

Lastly, the code snippet assumes that the application has the necessary permissions to access the file system. If not, a `java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException` will be thrown.

In this code snippet, we are getting the default file system and getting the file store of the root directory ("/"). Then we are calling the `isReadOnly()` method on the file store to check if it is read-only. The result is then printed to the console.

Please note that the actual behavior of the `isReadOnly()` method can depend on the underlying file system and the specific file store.

Also, the code might not work as expected if the file system does not support the `isReadOnly()` method or if the file store is not accessible. In such cases, an `IOException` will be thrown.

The `IOException` is caught and its stack trace is printed to the console for debugging purposes.

In this code snippet, we first get the default file system using `FileSystems.getDefault()`. Then we get the first file store from the file system using `getFileStores().iterator().next()`. Finally, we print the name of the file store using `name()`.

Please note that this code snippet may not work on all systems, as the availability of file stores can vary.

Also, the `getFileStores()` method returns an unmodifiable collection of the file stores that are part of this file system. If the file system has no file stores, the returned collection is empty.

The `name()` method returns a string that describes the file store. The string is suitable for display to the user and is suitable for use as a key in a map. The string is not necessarily unique, but it is unique among file stores that are part of the same file system.

The string is typically a file system name, such as "ext3" or "NTFS", followed by a colon and a volume name, such as "ext3:/dev/hda1".

The string may be empty if the file store does not have a name.

The string may be null if the file store does not have a name and the file system does not support querying the names of the file stores.

The string is immutable and is shared between all file stores that are part of the same file system.

Please replace "C:", "Users", "Public", "Documents" with your own directory paths.

Note: The `getPath()` method can take any number of arguments, including zero. If you pass in zero arguments, it will return a path with no components.

In this code snippet, we first get the default file system using `FileSystems.getDefault()`. Then we get the provider of this file system using the `provider()` method. The provider is an instance of `FileSystemProvider` that provides the implementation of the file system.

Please note that the `FileSystemProvider` class is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly. The actual providers are subclasses of `FileSystemProvider`, such as `FileSystemProvider` for the local file system and `ZipFileSystemProvider` for the zip file system.

The `FileSystemProvider` class provides methods for interacting with the file system, such as creating files and directories, reading and writing files, and so on.

The `FileSystem` class provides methods for interacting with the file system, such as getting the file system's root directory, getting the file system's separator, and so on.

The `FileSystems` class provides static methods for getting file systems, such as the default file system and file systems for specific URI schemes.

The `java.nio.file` package provides classes for working with file systems, paths, and file attributes. It is part of the Java NIO API, which is a new package introduced in Java 7 for working with new I/O features.
