@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful API methods from the `java.nio.file.FileStore` package:

1. `long getTotalSpace()`: This method returns the size, in bytes, of the file system.

2. `long getUsableSpace()`: This method returns the remaining space, in bytes, that may be used to allocate new files.

3. `long getUnallocatedSpace()`: This method returns the total space, in bytes, that is not allocated to any file in the file system.

4. `boolean isReadOnly()`: This method returns true if the file system is read-only.

Each of these methods returns a specific type and does not take any parameters.

Please note that the `getUnallocatedSpace()` method is not available in all implementations of the `FileStore` interface.

Also, the `isReadOnly()` method may not be available in all file systems.

The `name()` method returns a string that represents the name of the file system.

The `getTotalSpace()` and `getUsableSpace()` methods return the total and usable space, respectively, in bytes.

The `getTotalSpace()` method may throw `IOException` if an I/O error occurs.

The `getUnallocatedSpace()` method may throw `IOException` if an I/O error occurs.

The `isReadOnly()` method may throw `IOException` if an I/O error occurs.

The `name()` method may throw `IOException` if an I/O error occurs.
