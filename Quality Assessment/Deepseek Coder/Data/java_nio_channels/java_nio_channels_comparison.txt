@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful APIs from the `java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannelGroup` package:

1. `static AsynchronousChannelGroup open()`: This method opens a new AsynchronousChannelGroup.

2. `void shutdown()`: This method initiates the shutdown of this channel group.

3. `Future<Void> shutdownNow()`: This method initiates the shutdown of this channel group and returns a Future that will complete when all threads in the group have exited.

4. `int getMaximumLiveness()`: This method returns the maximum number of AsynchronousChannel instances that may be waiting to be accepted on this group's channels.

5. `int getThreadCount()`: This method returns the number of threads in this group.

Note: The `shutdown()` and `shutdownNow()` methods return a `Future<Void>` which can be used to check if the shutdown is complete.

Remember, these are not methods inherent from its parent class, they are specific to the `AsynchronousChannelGroup` class.

5. `public <A> void accept(A attachment, CompletionHandler<AsynchronousSocketChannel,? super A> handler)`: This method accepts a connection made to this channel's socket and transfers the connection to a CompletionHandler.

Note: The `accept()` method returns a `AsynchronousSocketChannel` which you can use to read and write data. The `accept(A attachment, CompletionHandler<AsynchronousSocketChannel,? super A> handler)` method is used to accept connections asynchronously.

Remember that these are just a few examples. The `java.nio.channels.AsynchronousServerSocketChannel` package has many more methods that you can use to create a server that can handle multiple connections concurrently.

Sure, here are five useful APIs from the `java.nio.channels.FileChannel` package:

1. `int read(ByteBuffer dst)`: This method reads bytes from this channel into the given buffer.

2. `int write(ByteBuffer src)`: This method writes bytes from the given buffer into this channel.

3. `long position()`: This method returns the current position of this channel's file pointer.

4. `FileChannel position(long newPosition)`: This method sets the position of this channel's file pointer.

5. `void close()`: This method closes this channel.

Note: The `position()` and `position(long newPosition)` methods return and accept a `long` value, representing the position in bytes.

Sure, here are five useful APIs from the `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock` package:

1. `void lock()`: This method acquires the lock unless the current thread is interrupted.

2. `void unlock()`: This method releases the lock.

3. `boolean isLocked()`: This method returns true if the lock is held by the current thread, false otherwise.

4. `boolean isHeldByCurrentThread()`: This method returns true if the current thread holds this lock, false otherwise.

5. `Condition newCondition()`: This method creates a new condition variable associated with this lock.

Note: The `newCondition()` method returns a `Condition` object, which is a subclass of `java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition`. It's used to wait and signal on this lock.

Sure, here are five useful APIs from the java.nio.channels.Selector package:

1. `Selector openSelector()`: This method opens a new selector.

2. `Set<SelectionKey> select()`: This method causes the current thread to block until one or more of the selector's registered channels is ready for I/O operations, the thread is interrupted, or the selector is closed.

3. `int selectNow()`: This method causes the current thread to block until one or more of the selector's registered channels is ready for I/O operations, the thread is interrupted, or the selector is closed.

4. `Set<SelectionKey> selectedKeys()`: This method returns a set of the keys whose corresponding channels are ready for I/O operations.

5. `Selector wakeup()`: This method wakes up all the threads waiting on this selector's selector.

Sure, here are five useful API methods from the `java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel` package:

1. `public static ServerSocketChannel open()`: This method opens a new server-socket channel.

2. `public SocketChannel accept()`: This method accepts a connection to this channel's connected socket.

3. `public void bind(SocketAddress local)`: This method binds this channel's socket to a specified local address and configures the socket to listen for connections.

4. `public void configureBlocking(boolean block)`: This method sets this channel's blocking mode.

5. `public <T> ServerSocketChannel setOption(SocketOption<T> name, T value)`: This method sets the given option on this channel.

Note: The `setOption` method is a generic method that takes a `SocketOption` object and a value of the type specified by the option. The return type of this method is `<T>`, which means it can be any type.

Remember, the `accept()` method returns a `SocketChannel` object, which represents the connection to the client. The `bind()` method takes a `SocketAddress` object, which represents the local address to which the server socket is bound. The `configureBlocking()` method takes a boolean value that determines whether the channel should be in blocking mode or non-blocking mode.

These methods provide a way to create, bind, and accept connections on a server socket channel, which is a key part of the Java NIO package.

Sure, here are five useful API methods from the `java.nio.channels.SocketChannel` package:

4. `void close()`: This method closes this channel.

5. `boolean isOpen()`: This method returns true if and only if this channel is open.

Each of these methods returns a specific type and takes in parameters of a specific type.

Note: The `connect` method does not return a value, it returns a boolean indicating whether the connection was successful or not.

Note: The `isOpen` method returns a boolean indicating whether the channel is open or not.

Note: The `read` and `write` methods return an integer indicating the number of bytes read or written.

Note: The `close` method does not return a value and does not take any parameters.
