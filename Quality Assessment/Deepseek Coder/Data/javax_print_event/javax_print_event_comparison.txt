I want to use javax.print.event.PrintEvent package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.print.event.PrintEvent` package:

1. `PrintEvent getPrintEvent()`: This method returns the PrintEvent object.

2. `PrintService getPrintService()`: This method returns the PrintService object associated with this PrintEvent.

3. `PrintRequest getPrintRequest()`: This method returns the PrintRequest object associated with this PrintEvent.

4. `PrintJob getPrintJob()`: This method returns the PrintJob object associated with this PrintEvent.

5. `PrintService getPrintServiceForState(PrintService.State state)`: This method returns the PrintService object for the specified state.

Please note that these are not methods inherent from their parent class, but they are methods of the `PrintEvent` class.

Also, please note that the `javax.print.event.PrintEvent` package is part of the Java Print API, which is not included in the standard Java SE API. You may need to add the Java Print API to your project dependencies if you want to use it.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.print.event.PrintJobAdapter` package:

1. `void printDataTransferCompleted(PrintDataTransferEvent pdte)`: This method is called when the data transfer is completed. The parameter is a `PrintDataTransferEvent` object.

2. `void printJobCanceled(PrintJobEvent pje)`: This method is called when the print job is canceled. The parameter is a `PrintJobEvent` object.

3. `void printJobNoMoreEvents(PrintJobEvent pje)`: This method is called when there are no more events for the print job. The parameter is a `PrintJobEvent` object.

4. `void printJobRequiresAttention(PrintJobEvent pje)`: This method is called when the print job requires attention. The parameter is a `PrintJobEvent` object.

5. `void printJobFailed(PrintJobEvent pje)`: This method is called when the print job fails. The parameter is a `PrintJobEvent` object.

Please note that these are the methods inherent from the `PrintJobAdapter` class, not the ones that are specific to this class.

Also, these methods are not part of the `java.util.EventListener` interface, so they are not part of the list of useful APIs for that interface.

The `PrintJobAdapter` class is a convenience class that provides default implementations for all of the methods in the `PrintJobListener` interface. It is often used as a superclass for classes that are interested in only a subset of the events.

The `PrintJobEvent` class is used to encapsulate the event information for a print job event. The `PrintDataTransferEvent` class is used to encapsulate the event information for a data transfer event.

These classes are part of the Java Print Service API, which provides a standard way to handle print jobs in Java applications.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.print.event.PrintJobAttributeEvent` package:

1. `PrintJobAttributeEvent.getSource()`: This method returns the object on which the event occurred.

2. `PrintJobAttributeEvent.getPrintJobAttribute()`: This method returns the attribute that has changed.

3. `PrintJobAttributeEvent.getOldValue()`: This method returns the old value of the attribute.

4. `PrintJobAttributeEvent.getNewValue()`: This method returns the new value of the attribute.

5. `PrintJobAttributeEvent.getClass()`: This method returns the Class object representing the runtime class of the object.

Please note that these are not methods inherent from their parent class, but they are methods of the `PrintJobAttributeEvent` class itself.

Also, these APIs are not exhaustive, and there may be more APIs in the package that are not listed here. Always refer to the official Java API documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.print.event.PrintServiceAttributeEvent` package:

1. `PrintServiceAttributeEvent(PrintServiceAttributeEvent source, PrintServiceAttributeSet attributes)`: This constructor creates a new `PrintServiceAttributeEvent` with the specified source and attribute set.

Please note that the `PrintServiceAttributeEvent` package is part of the Java Print API, which is not included in the standard Java API. You may need to add the necessary JAR files to your classpath to use it.
