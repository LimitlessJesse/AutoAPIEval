I want to use javax.security.auth.kerberos.DelegationPermission package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are the APIs from the `javax.security.auth.kerberos.DelegationPermission` package:

1. `public boolean implies(Permission p)`: This method checks if the specified permission is implied by this permission.

2. `public boolean equals(Object obj)`: This method compares this permission with the specified object for equality.

3. `public String getActions()`: This method returns the actions of this permission.

4. `public int hashCode()`: This method returns the hash code value for this permission.

5. `public String toString()`: This method returns a string representation of this permission.

Note: The `implies` method is inherited from the `Permission` class, so it is not included in the list.

Please note that the `DelegationPermission` class is a part of the Kerberos authentication package and it's not part of the standard Java API. It's used for Kerberos delegation, which is a mechanism for allowing a service ticket to be used to authenticate to another service.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosKey` package:

1. `byte[] getKey()`: This method returns the key data.

2. `String getKeyType()`: This method returns the key type.

3. `String getKeyUsage()`: This method returns the key usage.

4. `String getAlgorithm()`: This method returns the algorithm of the key.

5. `String getID()`: This method returns the ID of the key.

Please note that the `KerberosKey` class is an interface and cannot be instantiated directly. It is used to represent a Kerberos key. The actual implementation of this interface is provided by the Kerberos provider.

Also, the `KerberosKey` package is part of the Java Security API, which is not typically used directly in application code. It is used by the Java Kerberos implementation for handling Kerberos keys.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal` package:

1. `String getName()`: This method returns the name of the principal.

2. `String getRealm()`: This method returns the realm of the principal.

3. `boolean equals(Object another)`: This method compares this principal to the specified object.

4. `int hashCode()`: This method returns the hash code value for this principal.

5. `String toString()`: This method returns a string representation of this principal.

Note: The `equals` and `hashCode` methods are inherited from the `java.security.Principal` class, so they are not included in this list.

Please note that the `javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosPrincipal` package is part of the Java Kerberos API, which is used for handling Kerberos authentication. It provides classes and interfaces for working with Kerberos principals, which are used in the Kerberos authentication process.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosTicket` package:

1. `byte[] getClientAddress()`: This method returns the client's network address.

2. `long getEndTime()`: This method returns the time at which the ticket is no longer valid.

3. `long getRenewTill()`: This method returns the time at which the ticket should be renewed.

4. `long getStartTime()`: This method returns the time at which the ticket becomes valid.

5. `byte[] getTicket()`: This method returns the ticket itself.

Please note that these are not all methods available in the `KerberosTicket` class. The methods available may vary depending on the specific version of the Java SDK you are using.

Also, the `KerberosTicket` class is an interface and does not have any methods inherent from its parent class.

Remember to import the `javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosTicket` package at the beginning of your Java file.

```java
import javax.security.auth.kerberos.KerberosTicket;
```

Please note that the `KerberosTicket` class is part of the Java Kerberos API, which is not part of the standard Java SE API. You may need to add the necessary Kerberos libraries to your project to use this class.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.security.auth.kerberos.KeyTab` package:

1. `KeyTab.getKeyTab(File keyTabFile)`: This method returns a KeyTab object that represents the keytab file specified by the File object.

2. `KeyTab.getKeyTab(InputStream keyTabStream)`: This method returns a KeyTab object that represents the keytab file specified by the InputStream object.

3. `KeyTab.getKeyTab(byte[] keyTabBytes)`: This method returns a KeyTab object that represents the keytab file specified by the byte array.

4. `KeyTab.getKeyEntry(Principal keyPrincipal)`: This method returns a KeyEntry object that represents the key entry in the keytab file that matches the specified principal.

5. `KeyTab.getKeyEntry(Principal keyPrincipal, long keyVersion)`: This method returns a KeyEntry object that represents the key entry in the keytab file that matches the specified principal and key version.

Note: The `KeyTab` and `KeyEntry` classes are part of the `javax.security.auth.kerberos` package, and they are used for handling Kerberos keytab files.

The `Principal` class is part of the `javax.security.auth.Subject` package, and it represents the identity of a subject.

The `File`, `InputStream`, and `byte[]` classes are part of the `java.io` package, and they are used for handling file and stream input.

The `boolean` class is a primitive data type in Java, and it represents a boolean value (true or false).

The `E` class is a placeholder for any type, and it represents the type of the element to be added to the list.

The `add(E e)` method is a method of the `List` interface, and it appends the specified element to the end of this list.

The `Principal`, `File`, `InputStream`, `byte[]`, `boolean`, and `E` classes are not part of the `javax.security.auth.kerberos.KeyTab` package, but they are used in the API methods.
