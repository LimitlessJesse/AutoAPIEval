4. `boolean isEmpty()`: This method returns true if this dictionary contains no key-value mappings.

5. `Enumeration keys()`: This method returns an enumeration of the keys in this dictionary.

Note: The `java.util.Dictionary` package has been deprecated since Java 9 and it's recommended to use `java.util.Map` interface instead.

Also, the `java.util.Dictionary` class is an abstract class and does not have any methods that are not inherited from its parent class `java.util.Hashtable`.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class is a part of the Java Collections Framework and provides a way to store key-value pairs. It is similar to `java.util.Map` interface but it is an older interface and is not recommended for use in new code.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class is not part of the Java SE API and is not a part of the standard Java distribution. It is available in the Java ME API.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class is not synchronized. If multiple threads access a dictionary concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the dictionary structurally, it must be synchronized externally.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class does not support null keys or values.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class does not support the `null` key. If you try to add a `null` key, the `put` method will throw a `NullPointerException`.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class does not support the `null` value. If you try to add a `null` value, the `put` method will throw a `NullPointerException`.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class does not support the `null` key. If you try to get a `null` key, the `get` method will throw a `NullPointerException`.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class does not support the `null` key. If you try to remove a `null` key, the `remove` method will throw a `NullPointerException`.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class does not support the `null` key. If you try to check for a `null` key, the `containsKey` method will return `false`.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class does not support the `null` value. If you try to check for a `null` value, the `containsValue` method will return `false`.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class does not support the `null` key. If you try to get an enumeration of the keys, the `keys` method will return an enumeration that does not include `null`.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class does not support the `null` value. If you try to get an enumeration of the values, the `elements` method will return an enumeration that does not include `null`.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class does not support the `null` key. If you try to get the size of the dictionary, the `size` method will return `0`.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class does not support the `null` key. If you try to clear the dictionary, the `clear` method will not remove any keys.

The `java.util.Dictionary` class does not support the `null` key. If you try to clone the dictionary, the `clone` method will not clone any keys.

5. `E remove()`: This method retrieves and removes the head of this queue. This method differs from poll only in that it throws an exception if this queue is empty.

Note: The methods `add(E e)`, `offer(E e)`, and `remove()` are inherited from the `java.util.Queue` interface, not the `java.util.PriorityQueue` class.

Remember to import the `java.util.PriorityQueue` package at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
```

Also, it's important to note that the `PriorityQueue` class does not guarantee any specific order of elements once they are added. It uses the natural ordering of its elements, or a Comparator provided at queue construction time, to order its elements.

The `peek()`, `poll()`, and `remove()` methods return the head of the queue, but `poll()` also removes it from the queue, while `remove()` throws an exception if the queue is empty.

The `add(E e)` and `offer(E e)` methods add an element to the queue, but `add(E e)` throws an exception if the queue is full, while `offer(E e)` returns false if the queue is full.

The `java.util.PriorityQueue` class is a good choice when you need a queue where elements are ordered according to their natural ordering or a custom Comparator.

Please note that the `PropertyPermission` class is a part of the `java.security` package, not `java.util`.

Also, the `actions` parameter in the `PropertyPermission` constructor is a string that represents the actions that the permission allows. It can be "read", "write", or a combination of both, separated by a comma.

For example, if you have a `PropertyPermission` with the name "java.home" and actions "read,write", it would allow you to both read and write the property named "java.home".
