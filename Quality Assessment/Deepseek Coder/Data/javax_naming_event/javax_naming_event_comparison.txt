@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.naming.event.NamingEvent package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.naming.event.NamingEvent` package:

1. `Object getNewValue()`: This method returns the new value of the attribute that has changed.

2. `Object getOldValue()`: This method returns the old value of the attribute that has changed.

3. `String getType()`: This method returns the type of the event.

4. `Object getSource()`: This method returns the source of the event.

5. `String toString()`: This method returns a string representation of the event.

Please note that these are not all the methods in the `NamingEvent` class, but they cover the most commonly used ones.

Also, remember that the `NamingEvent` class is an abstract class, so you can't instantiate it directly. It's used as a base class for other event classes that are specific to the javax.naming package.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.naming.event.NamingExceptionEvent` package:

1. `Object getSource()`: This method returns the object that fired the event.

2. `String getErrorName()`: This method returns the name of the error.

3. `String getReason()`: This method returns the reason for the error.

4. `Throwable getException()`: This method returns the exception associated with the event.

5. `String toString()`: This method returns a string representation of the event.

Each of these methods does not have any parameters.

Please note that the `getSource()` method returns an `Object`, the `getErrorName()`, `getReason()`, and `toString()` methods return `String`, and the `getException()` method returns a `Throwable`.
