I want to use javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.CollapsedStringAdapter package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.CollapsedStringAdapter` package:

1. `public String marshal(String s)`: This method converts a string to a collapsed string.

2. `public String unmarshal(String s)`: This method converts a collapsed string back to a string.

3. `public String valueOf(String s)`: This method returns a collapsed string representation of the specified string.

4. `public String parse(String s)`: This method parses a string into a collapsed string.

5. `public String print(String s)`: This method converts a collapsed string to a string.

All these methods return a `String`.

Note: The `CollapsedStringAdapter` is used to convert between strings and their collapsed form, which is a form where all whitespace is replaced with a single space and leading and trailing whitespace is removed.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `javax.xml.bind.annotation.adapters.HexBinaryAdapter` package:

1. `String marshal(byte[] v)`: This method converts a byte array into a hexadecimal string.

2. `byte[] unmarshal(String v)`: This method converts a hexadecimal string into a byte array.

3. `String toHexString(byte[] bytes)`: This method converts a byte array into a hexadecimal string.

4. `byte[] fromHexString(String hex)`: This method converts a hexadecimal string into a byte array.

5. `String toString(byte[] bytes)`: This method converts a byte array into a string.

Each of these methods returns a specific type and takes in parameters of a specific type. For example, the `marshal` method takes in a byte array and returns a string.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `NormalizedStringAdapter` class:

1. `public String marshal(String v)`: This method is used to convert a Java object to an XML representation. The input parameter `v` is the Java object to be converted, and the return value is the XML representation.

2. `public String unmarshal(String v)`: This method is used to convert an XML representation to a Java object. The input parameter `v` is the XML representation to be converted, and the return value is the Java object.

3. `public boolean equals(Object obj)`: This method checks if this object is equal to the specified object. The input parameter `obj` is the object to be compared with, and the return value is a boolean indicating whether the two objects are equal.

4. `public int hashCode()`: This method returns the hash code value for this object. The return value is a 32-bit integer.

5. `public String toString()`: This method returns a string representation of this object. The return value is a string that contains the values of all the object's properties.

Note: The `NormalizedStringAdapter` class does not inherent any methods from its parent class.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.util.List` interface that are not inherent from its parent class:

1. `boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.
2. `void add(int index, E element)`: This method inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list.
3. `boolean addAll(Collection<? extends E> c)`: This method appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of this list.
4. `void clear()`: This method removes all of the elements from this list.
5. `boolean contains(Object o)`: This method returns true if this list contains the specified element.

And here are some methods from the `java.util.AbstractList` class:

1. `E get(int index)`: This method returns the element at the specified position in this list.
2. `int indexOf(Object o)`: This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if this list does not contain this element.
3. `int lastIndexOf(Object o)`: This method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if this list does not contain this element.
4. `E remove(int index)`: This method removes the element at the specified position in this list.
5. `boolean remove(Object o)`: This method removes the first occurrence of the specified element from this list, if it is present.

And here are some methods from the `java.util.AbstractSequentialList` class:

1. `ListIterator<E> listIterator(int index)`: This method returns a list-iterator of the elements in this list (in proper sequence), starting at the specified position in the list.
2. `List<E> subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex)`: This method returns a view of the portion of this list between the specified fromIndex, inclusive, and toIndex, exclusive.

And here are some methods from the `java.util.Collection` interface:

1. `int size()`: This method returns the number of elements in this collection.
2. `boolean isEmpty()`: This method returns true if this collection contains no elements.
3. `boolean contains(Object o)`: This method returns true if this collection contains the specified element.
4. `boolean remove(Object o)`: This method removes a single instance of the specified element from this collection, if it is present.
5. `Object[] toArray()`: This method returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection.

And here are some methods from the `java.util.RandomAccess` interface:

2. `E next()`: This method returns the next element in the list and advances the cursor position.
3. `boolean hasPrevious()`: This method returns true if there are more elements in the list.
4. `E previous()`: This method returns the previous element in the list and moves the cursor position backwards.
5. `int nextIndex()`: This method returns the index of the element that would be returned by a subsequent call to next(), or list size if the list iterator is at the end of the list.
6. `int previousIndex()`: This method returns the index of the element that would be returned by a subsequent call to previous(), or -1 if the list iterator is at the beginning of the list.
