I want to learn how to use XPathFactory newInstance() from javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is the complete code snippet using XPathFactory newInstance() method:

```java
import javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        XPathFactory xPathFactory = XPathFactory.newInstance();
        System.out.println(xPathFactory);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are creating an instance of XPathFactory using the newInstance() method. The newInstance() method returns a new XPathFactory instance. The returned XPathFactory instance is configured to use the default XPathFactory implementation.

Please note that you need to have the correct import statement for XPathFactory to run this code.

Also, please note that the XPathFactory class is part of the javax.xml.xpath package, so you will need to include that in your import statements.

```java
import javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory;
```

This code will print the XPathFactory instance to the console.

Here is the code snippet using `newXPath()` method from `XPathFactory`:

```java
import javax.xml.xpath.XPath;
import javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        XPathFactory xPathFactory = XPathFactory.newInstance();
        XPath xPath = xPathFactory.newXPath();
        System.out.println(xPath);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we first create an instance of `XPathFactory` using `XPathFactory.newInstance()`. Then we use `xPathFactory.newXPath()` to create a new `XPath` instance. The `XPath` instance is then printed to the console.

Please note that this code will not run as expected because `XPath` is an interface and cannot be instantiated directly. You would need to use a class that implements `XPath`, such as `javax.xml.xpath.XPathImpl`, to create an instance of `XPath`.

Here is the corrected code:

```java
import javax.xml.xpath.XPath;
import javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory;
import javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        XPathFactory xPathFactory = XPathFactory.newInstance();
        XPath xPath = xPathFactory.newXPath();
        String expression = "/bookstore/book[1]/title/text()";
        String xml = "<bookstore><book><title>Harry Potter</title></book></bookstore>";
        System.out.println(xPath.evaluate(expression, xml, XPathConstants.STRING));
    }
}
```

In this code, we use `xPath.evaluate()` to evaluate an XPath expression on an XML document. The result is then printed to the console.
