@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.swing.event.AncestorEvent` package:

1. `public Component getComponent()`: This method returns the `Component` that is the source of the event.

2. `public Component getAncestor()`: This method returns the `Component` that is the ancestor of the source component.

3. `public int getID()`: This method returns the ID of the event.

4. `public boolean isTemporary()`: This method returns a boolean indicating whether the event is temporary.

5. `public void dispatch()`: This method dispatches the event to all registered listeners.

Each of these methods returns a specific type and takes no parameters.

Please note that the `getID()` method returns an integer, `isTemporary()` returns a boolean, and `getComponent()` and `getAncestor()` return `Component` objects. The `dispatch()` method does not return anything (void), it dispatches the event.

Also, the `EventListenerListListener` interface is not a part of the `EventListenerList` class, it is a separate interface that you would need to implement if you want to listen for changes to the `EventListenerList`.

Remember to import the necessary classes and packages to use these methods.

```java

```java
EventListenerList listenerList = new EventListenerList();
// Add a listener
listenerList.add(EventListenerListListener.class, new EventListenerListListener() {
    // Handle events here
});
// Remove a listener
listenerList.remove(EventListenerListListener.class, new EventListenerListListener() {

@@ Instruction
I want to use javax.swing.event.TreeExpansionEvent package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.swing.event.TreeExpansionEvent` package:

1. `TreeExpansionEvent(Object source, int[] path, int[] pathCount)`: This is the constructor for the TreeExpansionEvent class. It takes in the source of the event, the path of the tree nodes that have been expanded, and the path count of the tree nodes that have been expanded.

2. `int[] getPath()`: This method returns the path of the tree nodes that have been expanded.

3. `int[] getPathCount()`: This method returns the path count of the tree nodes that have been expanded.

4. `Object getSource()`: This method returns the source of the event.

5. `int getType()`: This method returns the type of the event. The type can be either `TreeExpansionEvent.TREE_EXPANDED` or `TreeExpansionEvent.TREE_COLLAPSED`.

Please note that these are not methods inherent from their parent class, but they are useful methods for handling tree expansion events in Java.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.swing.event.TreeModelEvent` package:

1. `TreeModelEvent(Object source, int[] path, int[] childIndices, int type)`: This is the constructor for the TreeModelEvent class. It takes in the source of the event, the path of the node that changed, the child indices of the node that changed, and the type of the event.

2. `int[] getChildIndices()`: This method returns the child indices of the node that changed.

3. `int getType()`: This method returns the type of the event. The type can be one of the following: INSERT, REMOVE, or STRUCTURE_CHANGED.

4. `int[] getPath()`: This method returns the path of the node that changed.

5. `Object getSource()`: This method returns the source of the event. The source is typically the tree model that fired the event.

Note: The `TreeModelEvent` class does not have any methods that are inherited from its parent class.
