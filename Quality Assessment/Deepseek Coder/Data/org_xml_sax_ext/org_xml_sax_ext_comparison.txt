Sample: 0 Attributes2Impl
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Instruction
I want to use org.xml.sax.ext.Attributes2Impl package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `org.xml.sax.ext.Attributes2Impl` package:

1. `int getLength()`: This method returns the number of attributes in the list.
2. `String getQName(int index)`: This method returns the QName of the attribute at the specified index.
3. `String getValue(int index)`: This method returns the value of the attribute at the specified index.
4. `String getType(int index)`: This method returns the type of the attribute at the specified index.
5. `String getType(String qName)`: This method returns the type of the attribute with the specified QName.

Please note that these methods are not inherited from their parent class, they are specific to the `Attributes2Impl` class.

Also, it's important to note that the `Attributes2Impl` class is a part of the SAX (Simple API for XML) package, which is a Java library for parsing XML documents. It provides a way to access the attributes of an XML element.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `org.xml.sax.ext.DefaultHandler2` package:

1. `void startElement(String uri, String localName, String qName, Attributes atts)`: This method is called when an element's start tag is encountered.

2. `void endElement(String uri, String localName, String qName)`: This method is called when an element's end tag is encountered.

3. `void characters(char[] ch, int start, int length)`: This method is called when a segment of character data is encountered.

4. `void ignorableWhitespace(char[] ch, int start, int length)`: This method is called when a segment of whitespace is encountered.

5. `void processingInstruction(String target, String data)`: This method is called when a processing instruction is encountered.

Each of these methods has a specific return type and parameters. For example, `void startElement(String uri, String localName, String qName, Attributes atts)` does not return a value (void) and takes four parameters: the URI of the element, the local name of the element, the qualified name of the element, and an Attributes object containing the element's attributes.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `org.xml.sax.ext.Locator2Impl` package:

1. `public int getLineNumber()`: This method returns the line number where the current event has occurred.

2. `public int getColumnNumber()`: This method returns the column number where the current event has occurred.

3. `public String getPublicId()`: This method returns the public identifier of the current entity, or null if there is no public identifier.

4. `public String getSystemId()`: This method returns the system identifier of the current entity, or null if there is no system identifier.

5. `public String getBaseURI()`: This method returns the base URI of the current entity, or null if there is no base URI.

Please note that these methods are not inherited from their parent class, they are part of the `Locator2` interface, which extends `Locator` interface.

Also, please note that the `Locator2Impl` class is not part of the standard Java API, it's a part of the SAX (Simple API for XML) API.
