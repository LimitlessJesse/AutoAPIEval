Sure, here are five useful methods from the `java.util.stream.Collectors` package:

1. `Collector<T, A, R> toCollection(Supplier<Collection<A>> collectionFactory)`: This method returns a Collector that accumulates the input elements into a new Collection.

2. `Collector<T,?, List<T>> toList()`: This method returns a Collector that accumulates the input elements into a new List.

3. `Collector<T,?, Set<T>> toSet()`: This method returns a Collector that accumulates the input elements into a new Set.

4. `Collector<T,?, Map<K,U>> toMap(Function<? super T,? extends K> keyMapper, Function<? super T,? extends U> valueMapper)`: This method returns a Collector that accumulates the input elements into a new Map.

5. `Collector<T,?, Optional<T>> toOptional()`: This method returns a Collector that accumulates the input elements into an Optional. If the stream is empty, the Optional will be empty. If the stream is not empty, the Optional will contain the first element of the stream.

Each of these methods has a different return type and parameters.

Note: The `toCollection` method has a `Supplier<Collection<A>> collectionFactory` parameter, which is a function that supplies a new, empty Collection into which the elements will be inserted.

The `toMap` method has `Function<? super T,? extends K> keyMapper` and `Function<? super T,? extends U> valueMapper` parameters, which are functions that provide the mapping for the keys and values in the resulting Map.

The `toOptional` method does not have any parameters.

The `toList`, `toSet` methods do not have any parameters.

The `add` method is not part of the `java.util.stream.Collectors` package, it's a method of the `java.util.List` interface.

The `add` method is used to add an element to the end of a list. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the element was successfully added.

Sure, here are five useful API methods from the `java.util.stream.StreamSupport` package:

1. `static <T> Stream<T> stream(Spliterator<T> spliterator, boolean parallel)`: This method returns a sequential Stream, parallel Stream, or a short-circuiting parallel Stream depending on the second argument.

2. `static <T> Stream<T> stream(Spliterator<T> spliterator)`: This method returns a sequential Stream from the given Spliterator.

3. `static <T> Stream<T> stream(Iterable<? extends T> iterable)`: This method returns a sequential Stream from the given Iterable.

4. `static <T> Stream<T> stream(Iterable<? extends T> iterable, int size)`: This method returns a sequential Stream from the given Iterable and its estimated size.

5. `static <T> Stream<T> stream(Iterable<? extends T> iterable, Spliterator.OfRef<? extends T> spliterator)`: This method returns a Stream from the given Iterable and Spliterator.

Sure, here are five useful API methods from the `java.util.stream.Stream` package:

1. `Stream<T> distinct()`: This method returns a stream consisting of the distinct elements (according to `Object.equals(Object)`) of this stream.

2. `Stream<T> filter(Predicate<? super T> predicate)`: This method returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream that match the given predicate.

3. `<R> Stream<R> map(Function<? super T,? extends R> mapper)`: This method returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream.

4. `Stream<T> limit(long maxSize)`: This method returns a stream consisting of the elements of this stream, truncated to be no longer than `maxSize` in length.

5. `Stream<T> skip(long n)`: This method returns a stream consisting of the remaining elements of this stream after discarding the first `n` elements of the stream.

Note: All these methods return a new Stream instance and do not modify the original stream.
