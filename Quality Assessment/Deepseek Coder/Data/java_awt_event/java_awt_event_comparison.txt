@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.awt.event.ActionEvent` package:

1. `int getModifiers()`: This method returns the modifier keys that were pressed when the event occurred.

2. `Object getSource()`: This method returns the object that is the source of the event.

3. `long getWhen()`: This method returns the time when the event occurred.

4. `void paramString()`: This method returns a string representation of the event's parameters.

5. `void setActionCommand(String command)`: This method sets the action command for this event.

Note: The `getModifiers()` method returns an integer value representing the modifier keys that were pressed when the event occurred. The `getSource()` method returns the object that is the source of the event. The `getWhen()` method returns the time when the event occurred. The `paramString()` method returns a string representation of the event's parameters. The `setActionCommand()` method sets the action command for this event.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.awt.event.AdjustmentEvent` package:

1. `int getAdjustmentType()`: This method returns the type of adjustment event. The return type is `int`.

2. `int getValue()`: This method returns the value of the adjustment event. The return type is `int`.

3. `int getModification()`: This method returns the amount of change in the scrollbar's value. The return type is `int`.

4. `AdjustmentListener getSource()`: This method returns the object that originated the event. The return type is `AdjustmentListener`.

5. `int getScrollbarAction()`: This method returns the action that caused the event. The return type is `int`.

Note: The `getSource()` method returns an `AdjustmentListener`, not an `AdjustmentEvent`. This is because the source of an event is always an object that can listen for events, not the event itself.

Also, the `getAdjustmentType()`, `getScrollbarAction()` methods return integers that represent different types of events or actions, so you would need to refer to the Java documentation for more details on these.

For example:

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.awt.event.MouseAdapter` package:

1. `void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e)`: This method is called when the mouse button has been clicked (pressed and released) on a component.

2. `void mousePressed(MouseEvent e)`: This method is called when a mouse button has been pressed on a component.

3. `void mouseReleased(MouseEvent e)`: This method is called when a mouse button has been released on a component.

4. `void mouseEntered(MouseEvent e)`: This method is called when the mouse cursor enters the area of one of the components.

5. `void mouseExited(MouseEvent e)`: This method is called when the mouse cursor leaves the area of one of the components.

Each of these methods takes a `MouseEvent` object as a parameter.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.awt.event.MouseEvent` package:

1. `int getX()`: This method returns the X coordinate of the mouse pointer, relative to the top-left corner of the component where the mouse event occurred.

2. `int getY()`: This method returns the Y coordinate of the mouse pointer, relative to the top-left corner of the component where the mouse event occurred.

3. `int getButton()`: This method returns the button mask that represents the state of the mouse buttons when the event occurred.

4. `int getClickCount()`: This method returns the number of times the mouse button was clicked when the event occurred.

5. `int getModifiers()`: This method returns the modifier keys that were pressed when the event occurred.

Note: The `getButton()` method returns a bit mask that represents the state of the mouse buttons. The bit mask can be combined with the bitwise OR operator (`|`) to determine if a specific button was pressed. For example, `(e.getButton() & MouseEvent.BUTTON1)!= 0` would check if the left button was pressed.

Please note that the `MouseEvent` class does not have any methods that are inherited from its parent class `java.awt.event.InputEvent`.
