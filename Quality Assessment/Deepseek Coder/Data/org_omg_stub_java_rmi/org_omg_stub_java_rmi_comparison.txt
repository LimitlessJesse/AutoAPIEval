----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Instruction
I want to use org.omg.stub.java.rmi._Remote_Stub package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `org.omg.stub.java.rmi._Remote_Stub` package:

1. `Object invoke(Object methodName, Object[] args)`: This method is used to invoke a method on the remote object. It takes the method name as a string and an array of arguments, and returns the result of the method invocation.

2. `void connect(String host, int port)`: This method is used to establish a connection to a remote object. It takes the host name and port number as parameters.

3. `void disconnect()`: This method is used to disconnect from the remote object.

4. `boolean isConnected()`: This method returns a boolean indicating whether the stub is connected to the remote object.

5. `void setStubInvocationHandler(StubInvocationHandler handler)`: This method sets the StubInvocationHandler for this stub. The StubInvocationHandler is used to handle method invocations on the stub.

Please note that these are just a few examples. The actual APIs available in the `org.omg.stub.java.rmi._Remote_Stub` package may vary depending on the specific implementation.
