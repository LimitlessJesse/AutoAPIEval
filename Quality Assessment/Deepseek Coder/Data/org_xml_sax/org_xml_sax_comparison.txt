Sample: 0 HandlerBase

@@ Instruction
I want to use org.xml.sax.HandlerBase package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `org.xml.sax.HandlerBase` package:

1. `void startDocument()`: This method is called when the document parsing has started.
2. `void endDocument()`: This method is called when the document parsing has ended.
3. `void startElement(String uri, String localName, String qName, Attributes atts)`: This method is called when an element's start tag is encountered.
4. `void endElement(String uri, String localName, String qName)`: This method is called when an element's end tag is encountered.
5. `void characters(char ch[], int start, int length)`: This method is called when a character array representing textual data is encountered.

Please note that the `startElement`, `endElement`, and `characters` methods are overridden in the `HandlerBase` class, and they are the only methods that are not inherited from the parent class.

Also, the `startElement` method takes an `Attributes` object as a parameter, which represents the attributes of the element. The `Attributes` class has methods to get the number of attributes, get attribute names, get attribute values, etc.

The `endElement` and `characters` methods take `uri`, `localName`, and `qName` as parameters, which represent the namespace URI, the local name, and the qualified name of the element, respectively.

The `characters` method takes a character array, a start index, and a length, which represent the textual data and the range of the textual data in the character array.

Please note that the `HandlerBase` class is deprecated in Java 9 and later, and it's recommended to use the `ContentHandler` interface instead.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `org.xml.sax.InputSource` package:

1. `public int getByteStream()`: This method returns the underlying byte stream.

2. `public int getCharacterStream()`: This method returns the underlying character stream.

3. `public int getByteStream(String systemId)`: This method returns the underlying byte stream for the specified system identifier.

4. `public int getCharacterStream(String systemId)`: This method returns the underlying character stream for the specified system identifier.

5. `public void setByteStream(InputStream byteStream)`: This method sets the underlying byte stream.

6. `public void setCharacterStream(Reader characterStream)`: This method sets the underlying character stream.

7. `public void setByteStream(InputStream byteStream, String systemId)`: This method sets the underlying byte stream and the system identifier.

8. `public void setCharacterStream(Reader characterStream, String systemId)`: This method sets the underlying character stream and the system identifier.

9. `public void setByteStream(URL url)`: This method sets the underlying byte stream using the specified URL.

10. `public void setCharacterStream(URL url)`: This method sets the underlying character stream using the specified URL.

11. `public void setByteStream(URL url, String baseSystemId)`: This method sets the underlying byte stream using the specified URL and the base system identifier.

12. `public void setCharacterStream(URL url, String baseSystemId)`: This method sets the underlying character stream using the specified URL and the base system identifier.

13. `public String getEncoding()`: This method returns the encoding of the underlying byte stream.

14. `public void setEncoding(String encoding)`: This method sets the encoding of the underlying byte stream.

15. `public String getPublicId()`: This method returns the public identifier of the underlying byte stream or character stream.

16. `public void setPublicId(String publicId)`: This method sets the public identifier of the underlying byte stream or character stream.

17. `public String getSystemId()`: This method returns the system identifier of the underlying byte stream or character stream.

18. `public void setSystemId(String systemId)`: This method sets the system identifier of the underlying byte stream or character stream.

19. `public boolean getCertifiedText()`: This method returns whether the input source is certified text.

20. `public void setCertifiedText(boolean certifiedText)`: This method sets whether the input source is certified text.

Please note that the return types are represented as `int`, `void`, `String`, `boolean`, `InputStream`, `Reader`, `URL`, and `E`, which are the most common return types in Java. The parameters are represented as `E`, `byteStream`, `characterStream`, `systemId`, `encoding`, `publicId`, `baseSystemId`, `url`, and `certifiedText`, which are the most common parameters in Java.
