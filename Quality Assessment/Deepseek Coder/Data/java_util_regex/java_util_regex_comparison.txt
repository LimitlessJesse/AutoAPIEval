I want to use java.util.regex.Matcher package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful methods from the `java.util.regex.Matcher` class:

1. `public int start()`: This method returns the index within the string of the first character of the subsequence.

2. `public int end()`: This method returns the index within the string of the first character following the subsequence.

3. `public String group()`: This method returns the input subsequence matched by the previous match.

4. `public int groupCount()`: This method returns the number of capturing groups in the given regular expression.

5. `public boolean find()`: This method attempts to find the next subsequence of the input sequence that matches the pattern.

I want to use java.util.regex.Pattern package from Java

For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful methods from the `java.util.regex.Pattern` class:

1. `public static Pattern compile(String regex)`: This method compiles the given regular expression into a pattern.

2. `public Matcher matcher(CharSequence input)`: This method creates a matcher that will match the given input against this pattern.

3. `public String pattern()`: This method returns the pattern string of this `Pattern`.

4. `public int flags()`: This method returns the flags of this `Pattern`.

5. `public static Pattern quote(String s)`: This method quotes the given string so that it can be used in a literal pattern.

I want to use java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
The `java.util.regex.PatternSyntaxException` class is a runtime exception thrown to indicate that a given regular expression is invalid. It does not have any methods of its own, but it is used as a superclass for other exceptions that are thrown by the `java.util.regex` package. Therefore, it does not have any methods that can be used directly.

However, if you are catching `PatternSyntaxException` and want to get more information about the error, you can use the following methods:

1. `public String getMessage()`: This method returns a string representation of this `PatternSyntaxException`.

2. `public String getDescription()`: This method returns a description of the error.

3. `public IndexOutOfBoundsException getErrorIndex()`: This method returns the index where the error occurred in the input string.

Please note that these methods are not part of the `PatternSyntaxException` class itself, but are used to get more information about the exception.

Sure, here are five useful methods from the `java.util.regex.Pattern` package:

1. `Pattern compile(String regex)`: This method compiles the given regular expression into a pattern.

2. `Matcher matcher(CharSequence input)`: This method creates a matcher that will match the given input against this pattern.

3. `int[] find(CharSequence input)`: This method finds the next subsequence of the input sequence that matches the pattern.

4. `String[] split(CharSequence input)`: This method splits the given input sequence around matches of this pattern.

5. `boolean matches(CharSequence input)`: This method attempts to match the entire region against the pattern.

Each of these methods returns a specific type, as indicated in the format you provided.

Note: The `Matcher` class is a separate class in the `java.util.regex` package, not a method of `Pattern`.

Also, the `Pattern` class is final and cannot be subclassed, so it does not have any methods that are inherited from its parent class.
