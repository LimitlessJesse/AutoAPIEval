@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.io.BufferedInputStream` class:

1. `int read()`: This method reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If end of stream is reached, it returns -1.

2. `int read(byte[] b)`: This method reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the buffer array `b`. The number of bytes read is returned as an integer.

3. `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method reads up to `len` bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. The number of bytes read is returned as an integer.

4. `void close()`: This method closes the input stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream.

5. `int available()`: This method returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next caller of the `read()` method.

Note: The `read()` method inherent from its parent class `InputStream` is not included in the list.

Remember to always close your streams when you're done with them to free up system resources.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.io.BufferedOutputStream` class:

1. `void write(int b)`: This method writes the specified byte to the output stream. The argument b is an integer giving the byte to be written, which is any value between 0 and 255.

2. `void write(byte[] b)`: This method writes b.length bytes from the specified byte array to the output stream.

3. `void write(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset off to the output stream.

4. `void flush()`: This method forces any buffered output bytes to be written out to the stream.

5. `void close()`: This method closes the output stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream.

Note: The `write(int b)` method writes a single byte, while the `write(byte[] b)` and `write(byte[] b, int off, int len)` methods write an array of bytes. The `flush()` method forces any buffered output bytes to be written out, and the `close()` method closes the stream.

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.io.FileReader` package:

1. `FileReader(String fileName)`: This method creates a new FileReader, given the name of the file to read from.

2. `int read()`: This method reads a single character.

3. `int read(char[] cbuf)`: This method reads characters into a portion of an array.

4. `void close()`: This method closes the stream and releases any system resources associated with it.

5. `int read(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)`: This method reads characters into a portion of an array.

Each of these methods has a specific return type and parameters. For example, `FileReader(String fileName)` returns `void` and takes a `String` parameter.

Please note that `java.io.FileReader` does not have any methods that are inherited from its parent class `java.io.InputStreamReader`.

Also, remember to handle exceptions properly in your code to avoid runtime errors.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.io.FilterInputStream` package:

1. `int read()`: This method reads the next byte of data from the input stream. The value byte is returned as an int in the range 0 to 255. If no byte is available because the end of the stream has been reached, the value -1 is returned.

2. `int read(byte[] b)`: This method reads some number of bytes from the input stream and stores them into the byte array b. The number of bytes read is returned as an integer.

3. `int read(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method reads up to len bytes of data from the input stream into an array of bytes. The number of bytes read is returned as an integer.

4. `long skip(long n)`: This method skips over and discards n bytes of data from this input stream. The skip method may, for a variety of reasons, end up skipping over some smaller number of bytes, possibly 0.

5. `int available()`: This method returns an estimate of the number of bytes that can be read (or skipped over) from this input stream without blocking by the next caller of the read method for this input stream.

Sure, here are five useful APIs from the `java.io.OutputStream` package:

1. `void write(int b)`: This method writes the specified byte to the output stream. The argument b is an integer giving the byte to be written to the output stream.

2. `void write(byte[] b)`: This method writes b.length bytes from the specified byte array to the output stream.

3. `void write(byte[] b, int off, int len)`: This method writes len bytes from the specified byte array starting at offset off to the output stream.

4. `void flush()`: This method forces any buffered output bytes to be written out to the stream.

5. `void close()`: This method closes the output stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream.

Note: All these methods do not return any value (void), hence the return type is specified as `void`.

Remember, when using these methods, you should handle exceptions that may be thrown, such as `IOException`, to ensure the stream is properly closed and resources are released.

5. `ready():` Tests if a thread is waiting on this object's monitor to enter the object's synchronized method or block. The thread returns true if the thread is waiting; otherwise, it returns false.

```java
boolean ready() throws IOException
```

Note: The `PipedReader` and `PipedWriter` classes are used for inter-thread communication. They are part of the Java I/O package.

The `PipedReader` class provides the `read()` method for reading characters, and the `PipedWriter` class provides the `write()` method for writing characters. They are connected by a pipe, which is a mechanism for inter-thread communication.

The `PipedInputStream` and `PipedOutputStream` classes are similar to `PipedReader` and `PipedWriter`, but they operate on bytes rather than characters.

The `PipedInputStream` class provides the `read()` method for reading bytes, and the `PipedOutputStream` class provides the `write()` method for writing bytes.

The `PipedInputStream` and `PipedOutputStream` classes are part of the Java I/O package.

3. `void printf(String format, Object... args)`: This method formats the given arguments and writes the resulting formatted string to the print stream.

4. `void println(boolean x)`: This method prints the boolean argument and then terminate the line.

5. `void println(int x)`: This method prints the integer argument and then terminate the line.

Each of these methods returns `void`, meaning they do not return a value.

Note: The `printf` method is a bit more complex as it uses a format string and variable arguments. The format string follows the same syntax as `System.out.printf` in C/C++.

Remember to import the `java.io.PrintStream` package at the beginning of your Java file:

```java
import java.io.PrintStream;
```

Also, you should know that `PrintStream` is an output stream that can be used to write data to different targets. It is often used for debugging purposes.

```java
PrintStream out = new PrintStream(System.out);
out.println("Hello, World!");
```

In the above code, `System.out` is a `PrintStream` that represents the standard output stream. The `println` method of `PrintStream` is used to print the string "Hello, World!" to the standard output.

3. `long skip(long n)`: This method skips the specified number of characters in the stream. The skip method may, for a variety of reasons, end up skipping over some characters.

4. `int available()`: This method returns an estimate of the number of characters that can be read (or skipped over) from the input stream without blocking by the next caller of a method for this input stream.

5. `String getEncoding()`: This method returns the character encoding of the stream. The default encoding is UTF-8.

Note: The `read()` method inherent from its parent class `java.io.Reader` is not included.

Remember, the return types and parameters are based on the Java API documentation.

Also, please note that the `java.io.StringReader` class is a subclass of `java.io.Reader`, so it inherits all methods from its parent class. The `read()` method is one of them.

I want to use java.io.StringWriter package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.io.StringWriter` package:

1. `void write(int c)`: This method writes the specified character to this string writer.
2. `void write(char[] cbuf)`: This method writes the characters from a character array to this string writer.
3. `void write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)`: This method writes characters from a subarray of a character array to this string writer.
4. `void write(String str)`: This method writes a string to this string writer.
5. `void write(String str, int off, int len)`: This method writes a portion of a string to this string writer.

Each of these methods returns `void`, meaning they don't return any value.

Note: The `write(int c)` method writes a single character, while the `write(char[] cbuf)`, `write(char[] cbuf, int off, int len)`, `write(String str)`, and `write(String str, int off, int len)` methods write arrays and portions of strings, respectively.

4. `void write(String str, int off, int len)`: This method writes a portion of the specified string to the writer.
5. `void close()`: This method closes the writer and releases any system resources that it may be using.

Each of these methods returns void, as they are all used for writing data to the writer.

Note: The `close()` method is not inherent from its parent class, it's a method specifically designed for the Writer class.

Remember to always call `close()` when you're done with a writer to free up system resources.
