I want to use javax.xml.crypto.dsig.TransformService package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.xml.crypto.dsig.TransformService` package:

1. `TransformService lookupService(String transformURI)`: This method looks up a TransformService by its transformURI.

2. `TransformService[] listServices()`: This method returns an array of all available TransformService instances.

3. `Transform[] getAvailableTransforms()`: This method returns an array of all available Transforms.

4. `Transform getTransform(String transformURI)`: This method returns a Transform instance by its transformURI.

5. `Transform getTransform(String algorithm, String algorithmURI)`: This method returns a Transform instance by its algorithm and algorithmURI.

Note: The `TransformService` class is an abstract class and does not have any methods inherent from its parent class.

Please note that the availability of these APIs may vary depending on the specific version of the Java SDK you are using.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `javax.xml.crypto.dsig.XMLSignatureFactory` package:

1. `XMLSignatureFactory getInstance(String algorithm)`: This method returns an instance of XMLSignatureFactory that implements the specified algorithm.

2. `XMLSignature createSignature(String algorithm)`: This method creates a new XMLSignature object that uses the specified algorithm.

3. `Reference createReference(String uri, String transformAlgorithm, String digestAlgorithm, String digestMethod)`: This method creates a new Reference object with the specified URI, transform algorithm, digest algorithm, and digest method.

4. `CanonicalizationMethod createCanonicalizationMethod(String algorithm, String inclusiveNamespacesPrefixList)`: This method creates a new CanonicalizationMethod object with the specified algorithm and inclusive namespaces prefix list.

5. `Transform createTransform(String algorithm)`: This method creates a new Transform object with the specified algorithm.

Please note that these are just a few examples. The `XMLSignatureFactory` class has many other methods that you might find useful.
