Sample: 0 AddressingFeature_3
----------------------------------------------------------------

@@ Instruction
I want to learn how to use String getID() from javax.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

@@ Response
The `getID()` method in the `javax.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature` class is used to get the identifier of the SOAP message. The identifier is a unique string that is used to match the message with the corresponding response.

Here is the complete code snippet:

```java
import javax.xml.ws.soap.AddressingFeature;
import javax.xml.ws.soap.SOAPMessage;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a SOAPMessage
        SOAPMessage soapMessage = null; // You need to create this

        // Create an AddressingFeature
        AddressingFeature addressingFeature = new AddressingFeature();

        // Get the ID of the SOAPMessage
        String id = addressingFeature.getID(soapMessage);

        // Print the ID
        System.out.println("The ID of the SOAPMessage is: " + id);
    }
}
```

Please note that you need to create a `SOAPMessage` object before you can use the `getID()` method. The `SOAPMessage` object represents the SOAP message that you want to get the ID for.

Also, please note that the `AddressingFeature` class is part of the Java API for XML Web Services (JAX-WS), and it's not a part of the standard Java API. It's used for SOAP message addressing, which is a way to associate a response with a request.

If you're using a different library or framework, the method to get the ID might be different.
