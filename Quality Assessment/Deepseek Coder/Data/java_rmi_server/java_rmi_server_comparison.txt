@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.rmi.server.ObjID` package:

1. `boolean equals(Object obj)`: Compares this object to the specified object.
2. `int hashCode()`: Returns a hash code value for this object.
3. `String toString()`: Returns a string representation of the object.
4. `long getTime()`: Returns the current time in milliseconds.
5. `long currentTimeMillis()`: Returns the current time in milliseconds from the Epoch.

Please note that `java.rmi.server.ObjID` is a part of the Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) package and is not typically used directly in your code. It is used internally by the RMI implementation.

Also, the `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods are inherent from the `java.lang.Object` class, so they are not included in the list.

Please note that the `getTime()` and `currentTimeMillis()` methods are not part of the `java.rmi.server.ObjID` package, but they are part of the `java.lang.System` class.

Please note that the `java.rmi.server.ObjID` package is not part of the standard Java API, and it is not recommended to use it in your own code. It is used internally by the Java RMI implementation.

5. `public void notify()`: Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on this object's monitor.

Please note that these methods are not inherent from their parent class, but they are common methods that are often overridden in subclasses.

Also, it's important to note that the `java.rmi.server.Operation` package is not part of the standard Java API, so it might not be available in all Java environments.
