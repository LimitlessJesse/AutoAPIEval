For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.nio.channels.spi.AbstractInterruptibleChannel` package:

1. `int read(ByteBuffer dst)`: This method reads bytes from this channel into the given buffer.

2. `int write(ByteBuffer src)`: This method writes bytes from the given buffer into this channel.

3. `boolean isOpen()`: This method returns true if and only if this channel is open.

4. `void close()`: This method closes this channel.

5. `boolean isConnected()`: This method returns true if and only if this channel is connected.

Note: The `read()` and `write()` methods return the number of bytes read or written, which can be used to determine if the end of the stream has been reached.

Please note that these are not all methods of `java.nio.channels.spi.AbstractInterruptibleChannel`. The list is based on common usage and might not include all methods.

4. `void close()`: This method closes this channel.

5. `SelectionKey register(Selector sel, int ops, Object att)`: This method registers this channel with the given selector, and returns a new selection key that represents the registration.

Note: The `SelectionKey` is a key that represents the registration of a single channel with a single selector. It is used to identify ready operations and to attach callback objects.

Please note that these are not all methods of `AbstractSelectableChannel`, but they are some of the most commonly used ones.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.nio.channels.spi.AbstractSelectionKey` package:

1. `Object getObject()`: This method returns the object bound to this key.

2. `Selector getSelector()`: This method returns the selector for this key.

3. `SelectionKey interestOps(int ops)`: This method sets the interest set for this key to the given set of operations.

4. `int readyOps()`: This method returns the currently selected operations for this key.

5. `boolean isValid()`: This method returns true if and only if this key is still valid.

Please note that these are not methods inherent from their parent class, but they are useful methods for the `AbstractSelectionKey` class.

Sure, here are some useful methods from the `java.nio.channels.spi.AbstractSelector` package:

1. `int select()`: This method will block until some channel is ready for I/O operations. It returns the number of channels ready for I/O operations.

2. `int select(long timeout)`: This method will block until some channel is ready for I/O operations, or the timeout is reached. It returns the number of channels ready for I/O operations.

3. `Set<SelectionKey> selectedKeys()`: This method returns a set of keys whose corresponding channels are ready for I/O operations.

4. `int selectNow()`: This method will return immediately with the set of keys whose corresponding channels are ready for I/O operations.

5. `Selector wakeup()`: This method will cause the selector to return from its select or selectNow methods immediately.

Note: The `selectNow()` method is available from Java 7 onwards.

Remember, these methods are not inherited from their parent class, they are part of the `java.nio.channels.spi.AbstractSelector` package.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the `java.nio.channels.spi.AsynchronousChannelProvider` package:

1. `SelectorProvider openSelector()`: This method opens a new Selector. The Selector is used to monitor multiple channels for events.

2. `AsynchronousChannelProvider getDefault()`: This method returns the default AsynchronousChannelProvider.

3. `AsynchronousChannelProvider get(URL url)`: This method returns an AsynchronousChannelProvider that is identified by the specified URL.

4. `Set<String> supportedChannelTypes()`: This method returns a set of the names of the channel types that this provider supports.

5. `AsynchronousChannel newAsynchronousChannel(SocketChannel channel)`: This method creates a new AsynchronousChannel that is backed by the specified SocketChannel.

Note: The `openSelector()`, `getDefault()`, `get(URL url)`, and `supportedChannelTypes()` methods inherent from their parent class `AsynchronousChannelProvider`.

Please note that the `newAsynchronousChannel(SocketChannel channel)` method is not inherent from its parent class, it's a method of `AsynchronousChannelProvider`.

Also, the `AsynchronousChannel` is a sub-interface of `Channel`, which is a sub-interface of `Closeable`. So, it inherits all the methods of `Closeable`, `Channel`, and `AsynchronousChannel`.

The `Selector` is a sub-interface of `Closeable`. So, it inherits all the methods of `Closeable` and `Selector`.

The `AsynchronousChannel` interface has a method `read(ByteBuffer dst, A attachment, CompletionHandler<Integer,? super A> handler)`, which reads bytes from this channel into the given buffer. The `CompletionHandler` is a functional interface that defines the method `completed(V result, A attachment)`, which is called when the operation is completed.

The `AsynchronousChannelProvider` interface has a method `openAsynchronousChannel(SocketChannel channel)`, which opens a new AsynchronousChannel that is backed by the specified SocketChannel.

The `Selector` interface has a method `select()`, which waits for one or more asynchronous channel operations to complete.

The `AsynchronousChannel` interface has a method `write(ByteBuffer src, A attachment, CompletionHandler<Integer,? super A> handler)`, which writes bytes from the given buffer into this channel. The `CompletionHandler` is a functional interface that defines the method `completed(V result, A attachment)`, which is called when the operation is completed.

Sure, here are some useful APIs from the java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider package:

1. `Selector openSelector()`: This method opens a new selector. The selector is initially empty and must be registered with one or more channels before it can be used.

2. `Set<SelectionKey> selectedKeys()`: This method returns a set of keys whose corresponding channels are ready for I/O operations. The returned set is a view of the selector's internal set of keys, and changes to the selector's key set are reflected in the returned set.

3. `int select()`: This method causes the current thread to wait until one or more of the selected keys are ready for I/O operations.

4. `int select(long timeout)`: This method causes the current thread to wait until one or more of the selected keys are ready for I/O operations, or the specified waiting time expires.

5. `int selectNow()`: This method causes the current thread to return immediately if one or more of the selected keys are ready for I/O operations. If no keys are ready, the method returns immediately with a return value of zero.

Note: The methods `select()`, `select(long timeout)`, and `selectNow()` return the number of keys that are ready for I/O operations.

Please note that these are not all methods of the SelectorProvider class. The methods I have listed are the most commonly used ones.
