I want to use java.lang.management.LockInfo package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful APIs from the `java.lang.management.LockInfo` package:

1. `long getLockedMonotonicTime()`: This method returns the amount of time in nanoseconds that the current thread has been locked onto this object.

2. `long getWaitedMonotonicTime()`: This method returns the amount of time in nanoseconds that the current thread has been waiting to acquire this lock.

3. `ThreadInfo getThreadInfo()`: This method returns the `ThreadInfo` object associated with the thread that holds this lock.

4. `String getClassName()`: This method returns the fully qualified name of the class of the object which is locked.

5. `String getIdentity()`: This method returns a string that uniquely identifies this lock.

All these methods return specific types and do not take any parameters.

Note: The `getLockedMonotonicTime()` and `getWaitedMonotonicTime()` methods return the amount of time in nanoseconds. The `getThreadInfo()` method returns a `ThreadInfo` object, and the `getClassName()` and `getIdentity()` methods return strings.
