For example:

@@ Response
Sure, here are five useful API methods from the `java.nio.file.attribute.AclEntry` package:

1. `AclEntry(AclEntry.Builder builder)`: This method constructs an AclEntry from the given builder.

2. `AclEntry.Builder getBuilder()`: This method returns a new builder for this AclEntry.

3. `AclEntry.Builder setPermissions(Set<AclEntryPermission> perms)`: This method sets the permissions for this AclEntry.

4. `AclEntry.Builder setPrincipal(Principal principal)`: This method sets the principal for this AclEntry.

5. `AclEntry.Builder setFlag(AclEntryFlag flag)`: This method sets the flag for this AclEntry.

Note: The `AclEntryPermission` and `AclEntryFlag` are enums defined in the `java.nio.file.attribute` package.

Remember, these are just the methods from the `AclEntry` class. The `AclEntry` class extends `java.lang.Object`, so you will also have access to its inherited methods.

Sure, here are five useful API methods from the `java.nio.file.attribute.AclEntry.Builder` package:

1. `AclEntry.Builder setPermissions(Set<AclEntryPermission> perms)`: This method sets the permissions for the ACL entry. The permissions are represented as a set of `AclEntryPermission` objects.

2. `AclEntry.Builder setPrincipal(Principal principal)`: This method sets the principal for the ACL entry. The principal is represented as a `Principal` object.

3. `AclEntry.Builder setFlag(AclEntryFlag flag)`: This method sets the flag for the ACL entry. The flag is represented as an `AclEntryFlag` object.

4. `AclEntry.Builder setType(AclEntryType type)`: This method sets the type for the ACL entry. The type is represented as an `AclEntryType` object.

5. `AclEntry build()`: This method constructs and returns a new `AclEntry` object with the specified attributes.

Note: The `AclEntryPermission`, `Principal`, `AclEntryFlag`, and `AclEntryType` are enums representing different types of permissions, principals, flags, and types for ACL entries, respectively.

Please note that these are not inherent methods of the `AclEntry.Builder` class, but methods that are used to set the attributes of an ACL entry.
