I want to learn how to use void put(String key, Object value) from javax.script.AbstractScriptEngine
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");

Here is the code snippet for `void put(String key, Object value)` method from `javax.script.AbstractScriptEngine`:

```java
import javax.script.ScriptEngine;
import javax.script.ScriptEngineManager;
import javax.script.ScriptException;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScriptEngineManager manager = new ScriptEngineManager();
        ScriptEngine engine = manager.getEngineByName("JavaScript");
        
        try {
            engine.put("key", "value");
            System.out.println(engine.get("key"));
        } catch (ScriptException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we are using a JavaScript engine to execute the script. We are putting a key-value pair in the engine using the `put` method and then retrieving the value using the `get` method. The `get` method returns an `Object`, so we need to cast it to the appropriate type.

Please note that the `put` method is not part of the `javax.script.AbstractScriptEngine` class. It is part of the `javax.script.Bindings` interface, which is used to store variables and their values. The `javax.script.ScriptEngine` interface extends `javax.script.Bindings`, so any `ScriptEngine` instance can be used as a `Bindings` instance.

Also, the `put` method does not return a value, it simply adds the key-value pair to the bindings.

The `put` method is used to set the value of a variable in the script context. The key is the name of the variable and the value is the value of the variable. The value can be any object, including null.

The `get` method is used to retrieve the value of a variable from the script context. The key is the name of the variable and the method returns the value of the variable. The value is returned as an `Object`, so you will need to cast it to the appropriate type.

The `put` method does not throw any checked exceptions. If an error occurs while evaluating the script, the `get` method will throw a `ScriptException`.

In this code snippet, we are using `ScriptEngine` to execute JavaScript code. We are creating a new `ScriptEngine` instance using `ScriptEngineManager`. Then we are using `put` method to add a key-value pair to the `ScriptEngine`. After that, we are using `get` method to retrieve the value associated with the key. The retrieved value is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `get` method from `javax.script.AbstractScriptEngine` is used to retrieve the value associated with the specified key from the script context. The key is a string and the value can be any object. The method returns the value associated with the key, or null if the key is not found in the script context.

Also, please note that the `javax.script` package is not part of the Java standard library, it's a part of Java SE 11 or later. If you are using an older version of Java, you will need to add the `javax.script` library to your project.

Please note that the `getEngineByExtension` method returns a `ScriptEngine` for the specified extension. If the extension is not recognized, it will return `null`. In this case, we are using the "JavaScript" extension, so we will get a `ScriptEngine` for JavaScript.

Also, please note that the `ScriptEngine` class is part of the `javax.script` package and is not part of the Java standard library. It is a part of Java's scripting API, which allows you to embed scripting languages (like JavaScript) in your Java applications.

Please note that the `javax.script` package is not part of the standard Java API and is available only if you have the JavaFX or Java EE libraries installed.

Also, the `getEngineFactories()` method returns a list of all available script engines. The returned list is unmodifiable, and the order of the elements in the list is not specified.

If you want to get a specific script engine, you should use the `getEngineByName()` method instead.

```java

The name is the key that will be used to retrieve the value from the bindings, and the value is the object that will be stored in the bindings.

In the `main` method, we create a `SimpleBindings` object and use the `put` method to add a string value "John" to it. We then retrieve the value using the `get` method and print it to the console.

The output of this code will be:

```

This is because we put the string "John" into the bindings with the key "name", and then retrieved it using the key "name".

Finally, we retrieve the value of the "name" attribute from the context and print it.

Please note that the `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` class is not part of the standard Java API and it's available in the JDK 1.6 and later versions. If you're using an older version of JDK, you might need to download and install the Nashorn JavaScript engine separately.

Also, the `getAttribute(String name)` method from `javax.script.SimpleScriptContext` is used to get the value of an attribute with the specified name from the context. The attribute can be in different scopes like `ScriptContext.ENGINE_SCOPE`, `ScriptContext.GLOBAL_SCOPE`, or `ScriptContext.LOCAL_SCOPE`. In this code snippet, we are using `ScriptContext.ENGINE_SCOPE`.

The `getAttribute(String name)` method returns the value of the attribute with the specified name, or `null` if the attribute does not exist.

Please replace `"JavaScript"` with the name of the script engine you want to use. The name "JavaScript" is used here for demonstration purposes.
