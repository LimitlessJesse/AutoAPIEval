I want to use java.rmi.dgc.Lease package from Java
recommend a list of useful with at most 5 apis for this package, exlclude method inherent from its parent class
For each api method specify its return type and parameters in the below format

format: return_type method_name()

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

@@ Response
Here are the five APIs from the `java.rmi.dgc.Lease` package:

1. `long getValid()`: This method returns the time in milliseconds that the lease is valid.

2. `long getRenewalInterval()`: This method returns the time in milliseconds that the lease should be renewed.

3. `long getDuration()`: This method returns the time in milliseconds that the lease is valid for.

4. `long getCreationTime()`: This method returns the time in milliseconds that the lease was created.

5. `long getLastRenewalTime()`: This method returns the time in milliseconds that the lease was last renewed.

Here are the five APIs from the `java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock` package:

1. `void lock()`: This method acquires the lock.

2. `void lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException`: This method acquires the lock only if the current thread is not interrupted.

3. `boolean tryLock()`: This method tries to acquire the lock without blocking.

4. `boolean tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit) throws InterruptedException`: This method tries to acquire the lock, waiting up to the specified wait time if necessary.

5. `void unlock()`: This method releases the lock.

Here are the five APIs from the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package:

1. `boolean compareAndSet(int expectedValue, int newValue)`: This method atomically sets the value to the given updated value if the current value is equal to the expected value.

2. `boolean compareAndSet(long expectedValue, long newValue)`: This method atomically sets the value to the given updated value if the current value is equal to the expected value.

3. `boolean compareAndSet(Object expectedValue, Object newValue)`: This method atomically sets the value to the given updated value if the current value is equal to the expected value.

4. `int getAndIncrement()`: This method atomically increments the current value and returns the previous value.

5. `int getAndDecrement()`: This method atomically decrements the current value and returns the previous value.

Note: These methods are part of the `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicLong`, and `AtomicReference` classes in the `java.util.concurrent.atomic` package.

@@ Response
Sure, here are the APIs from the `java.rmi.dgc.VMID` package:

1. `VMID getPeerID()`: This method returns the peer identifier of the VM. The return type is `VMID`.

2. `VMID getUniqueID()`: This method returns a unique identifier for the VM. The return type is `VMID`.

3. `boolean equals(Object obj)`: This method compares this VMID with the specified object for equality. The return type is `boolean` and the parameter is `Object obj`.

4. `int hashCode()`: This method returns the hash code value for this VMID. The return type is `int`.

5. `String toString()`: This method returns a string representation of the VMID. The return type is `String`.

Please note that the `java.rmi.dgc.VMID` package is not part of the standard Java API and is not recommended for use in production code. It is primarily intended for use in the development and testing of RMI applications.
