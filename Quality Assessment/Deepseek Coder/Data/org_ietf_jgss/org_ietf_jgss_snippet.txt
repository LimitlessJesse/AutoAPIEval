I want to learn how to use boolean equals(Object o) from org.ietf.jgss.Oid
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

@@ Response
The `equals(Object o)` method in the `org.ietf.jgss.Oid` class is used to compare the equality of two `Oid` objects. This method is overridden from the `Object` class.

Here is a code snippet that demonstrates how to use this method:

```java
import org.ietf.jgss.Oid;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Oid oid1 = new Oid("1.2.3.4");
        Oid oid2 = new Oid("1.2.3.4");

        boolean isEqual = oid1.equals(oid2);

        System.out.println("Are the two OIDs equal? " + isEqual);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, two `Oid` objects are created with the same value. The `equals` method is then called on `oid1` with `oid2` as the argument. The result is stored in the `isEqual` variable. This variable will be `true` if the two `Oid` objects are equal and `false` otherwise. The result is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `org.ietf.jgss.Oid` class is part of the Java GSS-API, which is used for handling security-related tasks in Java. The `equals(Object o)` method in this class compares the two `Oid` objects based on their internal state, not their references.

Also, the `equals(Object o)` method in the `org.ietf.jgss.Oid` class is not part of the Java standard library, so you may need to add the necessary JGSS library to your project to use this method.

I want to learn how to use int hashCode() from org.ietf.jgss.Oid

@@ Response
The `hashCode()` method in the `org.ietf.jgss.Oid` class is used to compute the hash code of the object. The hash code is a unique identifier for the object.

Here is the complete code snippet:

```java
import org.ietf.jgss.Oid;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Oid oid = new Oid("1.2.3.4");
        int hashCode = oid.hashCode();
        System.out.println("Hash code: " + hashCode);
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create an `Oid` object with the value "1.2.3.4". Then we call the `hashCode()` method on this object to get its hash code. The hash code is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `hashCode()` method in the `org.ietf.jgss.Oid` class may not return the same value for different objects, as it depends on the specific implementation of the `Oid` class.

Also, the `org.ietf.jgss.Oid` class is part of the Java GSS-API, which is a set of Java bindings for the Generic Security Service Application Programming Interface (GSS-API). If you are not familiar with GSS-API, you may want to look into it before using the `Oid` class.

Here is the code snippet for the `toString()` method from the `org.ietf.jgss.Oid` class:

```java
import org.ietf.jgss.Oid;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Oid oid = new Oid("1.2.840.113554.1.2.1");
        System.out.println(oid.toString());
    }
}
```

In this code snippet, we create an instance of the `Oid` class with a specific string. Then we call the `toString()` method on this instance, which returns a string representation of the `Oid` object. This string is then printed to the console.

Please note that the `org.ietf.jgss.Oid` class is part of the Java GSS-API, which is a set of Java libraries for providing generic security services. The `toString()` method returns a string representation of the OID in the format defined by the ITU-T X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824-1:1994 standard.

If you are using a different library or class, the `toString()` method may have a different implementation.
