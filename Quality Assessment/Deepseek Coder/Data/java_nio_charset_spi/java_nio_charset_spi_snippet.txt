I want to learn how to use Charset charsetForName(String charsetName) from java.nio.charset.spi.CharsetProvider
Generate a complete code snippet of this method. The code snippet needs to be executable with import statement and put the method and code snippet in the format below:

Code snippet:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
    }
}

For example:
`boolean add(E e)`: This method appends the specified element to the end of this list.

Code snippet:
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
        list.add("Hello");
        System.out.println(list);
    }
}

Here is the complete code snippet of the `charsetForName(String charsetName)` method from `java.nio.charset.spi.CharsetProvider`:

```java
import java.nio.charset.Charset;
import java.nio.charset.spi.CharsetProvider;
import java.util.Iterator;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Iterator<CharsetProvider> providers = Charset.providers().iterator();
        while (providers.hasNext()) {
            CharsetProvider provider = providers.next();
            System.out.println(provider.charsetForName("UTF-8"));
        }
    }
}
```

This code snippet will print the `Charset` object for the "UTF-8" charset. The `Charset.providers()` method returns an iterator over all registered `CharsetProvider`s. We then iterate over these providers and call `charsetForName("UTF-8")` on each one, which returns the `Charset` object for the "UTF-8" charset.

Please note that the `CharsetProvider`s are loaded dynamically at runtime, so the actual `CharsetProvider`s used can vary depending on your Java runtime environment.

Also, the `CharsetProvider`s are loaded from the Java runtime environment's classpath, so you need to have the necessary JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) installed to use this method.
